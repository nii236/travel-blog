        <p>Getting used to the harsh environmental conditions now. Our goals today were to visit Hongkong island and find some good dim sum, visit the top rated bakery and find the street market over east in Causeway Bay.</p>

<p>Skipped breakfast today to save stomach space for dim sum. We ended up eating anyway over at Central Hongkong. We found the dimsum place but it looked very high end, plus it opened at 2pm! We ate congee across the road. Very tasty. I had pork giblets in the congee and Steph had pork liver and kidney. I put truckloads of soy sauce in the congee and then the taste reminded me of home! Mmm. Pretty cheap too, works out to about 6AUD each.</p>

<p>The top rated bakery was meant to be next door but there heaps of protesters in the area for some reason. Didn’t want to get in their way so we just headed off eastward to the markets in Causeway Bay.</p>

<p>We found plenty of bakeries along the way. In fact, we found plenty of everything. The problem I found with the bakeries was that most of their stuff is manufactured elsewhere and delivered later. This is because of the lack of space. Because of this, the Perth bakeries tend to be much fresher and tastier. We ran across some bakeries that had their own mini ovens and stuff in the back and those looked much better.</p>

<p>Anyway when we entered Causeway Bay we came across many salons and hairdressing places. Steph needed to get her hair bonded/straightened. It took about 4 hours total. I thought I might as well get my hair cut. This is the second time in my life since I’ve been to a hairdresser. I didn’t really know what to request so I just told him to cut it however he wanted. It ended up being some sort of horrific shark/piranha cut. Looks pretty bad but apparently all the other Hongkies in the area with my hair type has the same hair cut. So that makes me look a little more Chinese.</p>

<p>There was quite a long wait for Steph’s hair bonding so I decided to walk about the area. Lots of cool stuff actually. Lots of painful walking too unfortunately. I managed to buy some lovely flattened beef jerky stuff. Much better than Perth’s variety. Softer and tastier. Oilier too =/</p>

<p>At the end of our stay of Causeway Bay we went into Times Square which is a lovely department store similar to Galleria but is a stronger, better looking and more successful brother. We ate dim sum finally, but it was at a very high end place so was quiet and small servings. The menu was entire in Chinese so that made it a little more difficult. After dim sum dinner we found a dessert place and ate mango sago icecream fusion of some sort. Very tasty.</p>

<p>On the way back to our hostel room was a little bit of a nightmare because it was peak hour. And peak hour is annoying enough in Perth. There were perhaps thousands of people queuing up for the trains and fighting their way in. Each time the train left, another train comes about 30 seconds later. I was very impressed by this. After some pushing and shoving and gnashing of teeth we finally got in, squished with everyone else.</p>

<p>After we returned back to our base at home we went out to the shop and bought some nice matching jackets. They’re very nice.</p>
