        <p>We’re still in Dubai.</p>

<p>Today we attempted to go to the Jumeirah palm, which is the world’s largest artificial island.</p>

<p>But first we actually decided to go to the Dubai marina. This failed kind of miserably because it was completely empty. We were there about 10am which is when everything was opening but that didn’t really help because there were actually no customers there. Most of Dubai seemed to be like this, giant malls and marinas that have been sized by how much money the Emirates have, as opposed to necessity.</p>

<p>Anyway we walked around the marina for a few hours then got bored. We got stuck in the middle of nowhere trying to look for the marina mall. In the end we gave up (it was really sunny) so we just went to a nearby hotel and grabbed a taxi. We decided to go to the Jumeirah Palms directly.</p>

<p>The taxi driver asked us where exactly but we had no idea. The Palms was very big! We ended up getting dropped off at the monorail near Atlantis. This is a big water park where you can swim with sharks and stuff. Like literally. They put a big astronaut helmet on you then you walk around on the seabed with sharks everywhere. We didn’t go in though, we were a little strapped for cash.</p>

<p>We were getting desperate for Asian food so we hung around the only Chinese restaurant there until it opened for lunchtime. Had to wait for about an hour and half. I had kuay teow noodle stuff and Steph had wonton noodle soup. The dessert platter afterwards was unimpressive though.</p>

<p>Steph has had a sore throat since the beginning of the trip so her eating habits have been restricted. Under normal circumstances we would’ve probably blown our whole food budget on the first day.</p>

<p>Anyway we jumped on the monorail and took a scenic train right through the Palm. As usual noone was around. Kids were crying a lot. Took a taxi to the Wild Wadi Water Park!</p>

<p>The water park was probably the highlight of the Dubai part of the trip so far. Awesome rides. My favourite was the one with the vertical drop. You stand in a drop pod and then the floor disappears then you fall almost vertically for about 10 seconds. Quite frightening.</p>

<p>The worst part of this were obnoxious Indian kids everywhere. Normally this isn’t a problem but there were about 300 of these annoying kids everywhere. It was a school excursion of some sort.</p>

<p>Long day. Managed to find some local food for dinner. It was a place called Foul W Hummus. Bought hummus with meat and some other stuff. Really cheap too! It worked out to about 10 bucks for both of us. Interestingly the people here like to give truckloads of complementary bread with everything. Steph says the food from this place  was the highlight of the Dubai part of the trip…</p>
