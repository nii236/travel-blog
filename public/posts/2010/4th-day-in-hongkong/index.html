Woke up, ate breakfast. Steph ordered continental breakfast but was crappy, egg was cooked on the outside but inside the whites and yolk were completely raw. Wanted to complain but our Chinese consists of ‘thankyou’. I ate satay beef with instant noodles! Pretty good actually. Had scrambled eggs and butter bun too.
Went to Causeway Bay again for Stephs rebonding of hair." />

        <p>Losing motivation to write detailed accounts of each day. Will summarize.</p>

<p>Woke up, ate breakfast. Steph ordered continental breakfast but was crappy, egg was cooked on the outside but inside the whites and yolk were completely raw. Wanted to complain but our Chinese consists of ‘thankyou’. I ate satay beef with instant noodles! Pretty good actually. Had scrambled eggs and butter bun too.</p>

<p>Went to Causeway Bay again for Stephs rebonding of hair. Took about 2 hours. I went for a walk everywhere and stole internet to call Victor, Sami and home.</p>

<p>After that we went to the Causeway Bay markets. Bought some jeans and fur tail things. Quite cheap, except the store owners are very anal about prices. We managed to haggle, with great effort, the fur tail thing from 99HKD down to 95HKD. That’s about 50 cents.</p>

<p>After that we ate rice pizza! Very nice, I’d like to make it back at home. Its like a pizza but with a nice crispy base of hot plated rice underneath.</p>

<p>After rice pizza we ate Haagan Dazs love mini boat, a lovely dessert from a lovely ice cream store.</p>

<p>Steph learnt the word for ‘key’ in Cantonese, since we needed a key to access the bathroom. Sounds like “saucy”. Not too useful, but we might need it one day when a key is needed to save someone’s life.</p>

<p>After that went back to hostel to take a break. Steph was not feeling well so I went for a walk for 2 hours around the area. Bought some shirts, sweaters and jeans from Bossini, a lovely cheap but mid range store. Came back to get Steph. We went and ate Vietnamese food for dinner! The staff spoke no Vietnamese. Food was actually pretty good. I ate Pho but there was no Hoai Xinh sauce! I was very sad.</p>
