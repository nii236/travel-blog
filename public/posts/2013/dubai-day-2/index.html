        <p>Day two! We’re still in Dubai.</p>

<p>We realised that we didn’t budget properly for our time in Dubai. So we have decided to eat like the less fortunate people… At the food court!</p>

<p>Also today is ski day. Yes, we decided to ski in a desert.</p>

<p>Weirdly enough the city tends to open at 10am, as opposed to the 9am that I’m used to. Or in the case of crazy Australia cafes, 6am.</p>

<p>Anyway so we went skiing. The first step was to get a power pass which grants us access to the snow park as well as all the upgrades possible in the snow park and then you get one skiing lesson included.</p>

<p>The snow park was… Unimpressive. Tiny, understaffed, unfriendly and uninspired rides. Don’t do it! Waste of money. The chair lift people didn’t help us when needed so we missed a stop.</p>

<p>The skiing lesson was definitely better. We took the discovery lesson together. Was one hour of going up a travelator, skiing down while braking and attempting to turn. We had a lesson with a very obnoxious Indian guy from London. Between sessions of berating his wife he would be attempting to slow down on the skis but crash impressively into the wall. The wall was unfortunately padded. Anyway the skiing was great fun and redeemed the wasted cost of the power pass a little. I still prefer snow boarding but Steph likes skiing because it means less falling on your bum.</p>

<p>After Al halabi yesterday we realised we were not wealthy enough to eat at those sorts of places regularly. So we went to the food court! Ate some sharwarma which sounds cool but is just shaved meat from a slab of meat. Also had some fried keppeh which is fried meat. Quite good. It looks like the infamous hom sui gok. An interesting point is that they always give free bread with everything whenever one eats out in Dubai. Truckloads of it too! Turkish bread is much thinner and easier to eat.</p>

<p>Later in the day we decided to visit a mall called the Ibn Battuta. This mall is named after a great explorer who visited far lands. Because of this the mall is divided into six sections, one for each of his travels. China, India, Persia, Egypt, Tunisia and Andalusia. See photos below. The mall itself was kind of boring, same shops.</p>

<p>Our target was to walk all the way to china and then had to go back to take the train. This felt like approximately 1km each way. It was probably much shorter but we are not good at walking. On the way back we asked the information desk if there was a bus that can take us back to the Egypt section. The guy looked at us in a funny way and said it’s just a ten minute walk. Our legs were starting to fail so I insisted there must be a club car of some sort. The information guy said there was one but we had to pay for it. Being the stingey people we are we said no and limped away in defeat towards Egypt. He probably thought we were the most pathetic people in the world. In our defence we just finished a skiing season so our legs were busted in the first place.</p>

<p>Once we made it to Egypt we decided to eat japanese food. Obviously since we were in Dubai. Or not. Anyway the food was decent and we got our asian food while in Egypt.</p>

<p>Once we got back we basically fell into bed unconscious from the busy day. Probably around 9pm. With this sort of brutal treatment of our bodies we will soon become walking machines!</p>
