<p>So yeah this part of the trip was mostly just winding down. I bought a bunch of high value goods. Laptop, watch, games etc. There is a computer plaza here which to be honest, is pretty crap. Lots of old refurbished stuff and fake Chinese devices. After purchasing all my gear I discovered a superior shop across the road that is comparable to JB Hifi or something. New products, decent prices! Alas I am doomed to Buyer’s Remorse. The laptop I bought is decent at least. It can actually multitask without spitting the dummy unlike my current netbook back at site.</p>

<p>We had a look at the Dubai Mall today. One of the biggest malls in the world I think? I can certainly confirm that. There is an entire Souk area which is just selling gold, diamonds and precious gems. I wasn’t really in the market for billion dollar gold ingots or something so we didn’t stay in that area for long.</p>

We didn’t go inside because it didn’t really look like much value for money going into that tunnel. The panel on the outside absolutely amazing though.</p>

I was waiting for some sort of survival of the fittest thing to start but none of the fish ate the others.There was also Candyland! Very impressive. I guess this is just a giant candy shop but its got awesome interior design like most shops in Dubai. Hard to explain the place really. Some pics:</p>

Like I can just jump off a waterfall to my doom without a care in the world.That pretty much concluded the entire holiday I think! We headed off to the airport after a rest in the hotel.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if I mentioned it before but DAMN the taxi drivers here drive so fast! I know I complained about it a few years back in my Hong Kong post but now I realise I was just being a wuss. The speed limit here is 100km/h which is normal enough. But they often drive as fast as they can. Seriously. Regular speeds of 130km/h here folks. Interestingly the speedometer has an inbuilt alarm at 120km/h. Its an alarm that means “WARNING! You’re about to take off!” I think. I can only assume the taxi drivers are wannabe pilots because they all leave the alarm beeping and zoom around 130km/h anyway.</p>

<p>We get the business class flight this time! Woot! Steph and I stayed in the business lounge for awhile, had some snacks, had a nap on horrible uncomfortable beds. Steph had to fly out about 5 hours before me so we said our goodbyes. She loved the business class flight! Rightfully so too, it’s a different league to cattle class. Too bad I won’t be able to enjoy business class much longer after this job in Ghana…</p>
