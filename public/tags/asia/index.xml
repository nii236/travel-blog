      <description>I feel guilty.
Singapore trip finished last week! I&amp;rsquo;ve been too lazy to actually document my travels this time around.
I really didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy my last trip to Singapore. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even find a decent blog post on it! Either that it got deleted during my various migrations to different blogging platforms.
Nothing has changed unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ll be shoving my blog post into a single one again, mostly for future reference.</description>

      <title>Hong Kong Mk III Part Three - Other Stuff</title>

      <description>Tech stuff I love Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s airport express train&amp;rsquo;s progress bar.
One of the malls had seating areas which exist only to charge your phone. Its a great idea! Too bad my phone&amp;rsquo;s battery capacity is too big now, so these are useless to me.
Neat shops Ghibli Shop! Ghibli shops are great! The studio doesn&amp;rsquo;t make movies anymore (I think?) so its nice to see that the knick knacks are still being sold.</description>

      <description>This won&amp;rsquo;t be a daily blog, mostly because life in Hong Kong tends to blur into a big mush of stuff. So here are some highlights.
Food in Hong Kong! Service The workers here work at a breakneck pace, and I find myself constantly slowing everyone down. Its a lovely change from Malaysia. Here in Hong Kong, the service is bad because there are a billion people and so much to do.</description>

      <description>Hello again! Here we are in Hong Kong yet again. This is our third time here! I guess we never learn. Who would&amp;rsquo;ve thought that Hong Kong is not the most ideal place to relax and chill out.
Anyway might as well track our progress. When I&amp;rsquo;m 100 years old I&amp;rsquo;ll be saying wise words such as:
 Damn son, I was in Hong Kong 3 times by the time I was your age.</description>

      <description>Miyajima Day 2 Damn today was extremely hot and humid. I felt like I was having a bath, except with clothes on and while standing. The overly accommodating but creepy Minshuku owner gave us paper fans, which was probably the most useful equipment that we&amp;rsquo;ve had this entire trip.
It was nice to have a change of scenery from the city, although it was only for two days. By the end of the day, we were looking forwards to returning back to civilisation.</description>

      <description>Miyajima Ok here we go. Itsukushima island (yes I know I just said Itsuku-island Island).
The home of the killer deer apparently. They will go through your bags and stuff. I better bring a baseball bat&amp;hellip;
Oh. Never mind.
This is all future tense of course. We&amp;rsquo;re currently on a rocket ship on rails known as the Shinkansen!
I always get a kick out of going in one. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the Nozomi, which is the express Shinkansen.</description>

      <description>Homestay Masterchef Steph learnt to cook some tamagoyaki today! The host mother was happy to teach.
I think it turned out okay, it tasted good. But then again, eggs are always da best!
Those mini sausages were also very tasty! 
Kobe City Today we decided to go ahead and explore the city in Kobe. It was HOT! Not hot hot, but sticky, humid hot. We don&amp;rsquo;t know why everyone was complaining that yesterday was hot, when it was miserable, raining and cool.</description>

      <description>First day in Kobe &amp;hellip;which didn&amp;rsquo;t actually have anything to do with Kobe 
Step 1. Find some suitable clothing It has been overcast and raining pretty much non-stop since we got here. This was never the plan really, as Steph only packed 8kg full of short shorts, tank-tops, and thin blouses. Everyone else in Himeji is walking around in jeans, jackets, raincoats and boots, so she felt really out of place.</description>

      <description>Deer-land! Deer everyone,
Today we went to Nara Park! Oh deer-ie me. I think I should stop with these lame puns or you, my precious reader, will decide to stop reading.
And we all know this blog needs more hits. I get like, one hit per year (hi Mum!).
I discovered an electric vehicle quick charging station!
I was scared to use this tap at the guesthouse. Who knows what each of those million dials could do.</description>

      <description>Nara! 奈良市! Big Temples and Stuff! Hello! We&amp;rsquo;ve finally landed in Japan. We&amp;rsquo;ve been to this country way too many times yet here we are! I think its because we&amp;rsquo;ve reached the point where going to Japan is just a comfortable process. We speak the language (terribly), and we can blend in (terribly)!
We took Malaysia Airlines this time to the country. The flights were cheaper and quite empty. I assume its because of the recent issues Malaysia Airlines have been having regarding keeping track of their planes, but seriously the flight was pretty good.</description>

      <description>Today we rode our bikes around. Tried to go to ryougoku by bike. Took ages but it was closed when we got there! Very disappointing, was looking forward to eat sumo food. Not so I can get fat(ter) or anything. Just that it’s one of those foods that people don’t know about. Maybe it tastes awful?
We then went to Shinjuku in the evening. Kabukicho had a pretty DODGY vibe to it so we didn’t stay long.</description>

      <description>Aaand we are back in Japan. I suppose it was going to happen eventually.
This time around will be Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, but this time we will be adding Takayama to the list. Popular vacation town in the middle of the mountains somewhere. As luck would have it a volcano erupted there recently. Luckily the winds a blowing the ash in the other direction so we should be good.</description>

      <description>Jeonju! The City of Gastronomy! I’m guessing that means they have tasty food there. Lets see shall we…
This blog post covers two days in Jeonju, it was an overnight stay at a traditional style room, complete with rock hard thin mattresses, sleeping on the floor, and heatpiped flooring (amazing!)
So old yet so new (the place just recently finished with renovations actually)
This is an image of outside the room.</description>

      <description>GANGNAM STYLE! We went to Gangnam today just because we could. Big regret, didn’t know what to do, where to go. Turns out its a huge district, and the actual tourist places aren’t at Gangnam station, they’re at Gangnam district! So you have to stop at another subway stop.
Regardless we pushed on to the Kukkiwon Taekwondo Headquarters. Its like the pilgramage I didn’t plan to do.
 …Too bad it sucked.</description>

      <description>Woof! We tried to go to another dog cafe this time (last time was in Busan if you remember). The first attempt was very disappointing, filthy, and mostly consisted of toy dogs yapping in your face constantly. We decided to give it another go as other online blogs have promising pictures.
In the end, it was the right decision to make. Giant wolf dogs abound!
…In fact, I think we accidentally went to a wolf cafe, not a dog cafe.</description>

      <description>These last few days weren’t that particularly exciting. They mostly involved shopping, eating, learning how to cook, or just sleeping. But that’s the best kind of holiday for us. Though there was a pretty awesome place we went to the following day…
Our new hostel is in the Honggik university area which was fantastic. Young culture and stuff. Did some shopping in the neighbouring Ehwa Women’s University area. Strangely enough there were mostly women’s clothing there, of a more preppy variety.</description>

      <description>We had a late morning as we wanted to enjoy the ridiculous amount of space we had in the hotel. Went back to the hostel sheepishly to grab some stuff for the day.
Today we had tickets to the Nanta cooking show. It’s one of Korea’s biggest tourist shows apparently. I can see why, it was really good! Very amusing show.
We went to myeongdong after that and it was pretty cool.</description>

      <description>Master chef Nii and lowly kitchen minion StephCooking! We did some cooking classes in the morning and it was pretty good. I’m not much of a chef but at least the assistants there clean up after me so it takes out the worst part of cooking.
Morning class: 3 kinds of BBQ Afternoon class: spicy chicken stew and japchae
More spicy food! Always spicy food :(Two cooking classes in a row!</description>

      <description>Hello again! We took the KTX to Seoul today. The bullet train is awesome! Makes you see how much further Perth has to go with regards to public transport. Actually that’s not fair, the South Korean transit system is probably world class. But it’s remarkably similar to every other subway in Asia, so I’m guessing there is one consultant somewhere who is making absolutely oodles of money selling his subway design skills.</description>

      <description>This is our last full day in Busan. We went to the beach, aquarium and puppy cafe.
Haundae beach was recommended by a friend but I guess I forgot that neither myself nor steph care about these beach things. I think I’ve been to the beaches in Perth less than 10 times over my short life so far.
Anyway it was pretty empty and no one was actually swimming. It might have been because of the extremely cold temperatures, or maybe the Koreans hate swimming like me!</description>

      <description>Well hello there! This is our first time in South Korea (not Best Korea). We’ve been in Busan for three days and I’m writing this as I’m on the bullet train to Seoul.
Day 1 mostly consisted of us sleeping the whole day and recovering from the plane trip. I feel like an old man sometimes.
This country is remarkably similar to Taiwan and Japan. The people are much louder, and a lot worse at staying on their side of the footpath.</description>

      <description>Hi all,
We’re gonna be leaving for Kyoto later today. The place we’re staying at is kindof dodgy actually, its 40 minutes away from the city centre and has a curfew. Plus it looks like a giant complex of some sort. Its a youth hostel, rather than a backpackers hostel so I don’t really know what to expect. Utano Youth Hostel link. Packing up now. Seeyou soon.</description>

      <description>Greetings all! Nice to have wifi at Osaka. We went out today, only 3 of us because the others were too busy sleeping. I managed to buy some clothes (!). I got a jacket thats waaay too small for me, so I’ll have to slim down when I get back from japan. I also got a sweet watch thats sortof transparent so you can see the innards. Also got some manga to practice Japanese with (Death Note, Trigun and Haruhi Suzumiya).</description>

      <description>Ahh made it to Osaka. It was a 7 hour bus ride! The stupid driver kept accelerating and decelerating as well, so I’ve got really bad motion sickness. I really wanted to take the bullet train instead, but Alas and the others wanted to save money. On the way back to Tokyo I’ll probably take the bullet train, because that bus ride was awful.
Upon arriving, we got lost as usual.</description>

      <description>Hey all,
Sorry for the lack of updates. My laptop still has no wifi, and I’ll hopefully get it fixed soon. Hakuba trip is finished, snowboarding is great fun. I wish to do it again often. I’m going to leave in about 2 hours for Nagano, then taking the 7 hour bus to Osaka.</description>

      <description>I’ve been getting lazy uploading photos onto here, mostly because its such a poorly designed system. I’m disappointed in you Google! These photos are of our last few days in Tokyo. We went to Roppongi and Jump Festa. Roppongi was a really seedy red light district. There are lots of Nigerian hustlers on the streets (more annoying than the Mexican ones in Las Vegas actually). We went to a club called Gas Panic.</description>

      <description>Completed another day of snowboarding. We were all meant to get up at 630am, but since we were all so tired from yesterday we ended up getting out of the house about 9 or 10am. Snowboarding was much more fun today, I managed to fall about 3&amp;frasl;4 as much as yesterday. I’ve also learnt to fall on different parts of my body, so by the end of the week my entire body should be manageable.</description>

      <description>Went snowboarding yesterday. Very humiliating, as I kept falling over. Also extremely painful for your wrist and tailbone. I couldn’t get up this morning becauase of how sore I was. But I am now awake and off to do it again. I should really take lessons, but I’m hoping all this youtube watching and forum reading will be enough =)
After 4 days of this stuff I should be pretty good I hope.</description>

      <description>Melon bread! This stuff is really good. I’ve bought like 5 already. Its custard centre is rockmelon flavoured. The outer green bit is flavoured too!
Here are some photos of Asakusa. Its about 10 or 20 minutes walk from here. The giant senso-ji temple is here. They put raincoats on the mascots outside the building when it rains! The other day they put santa costumes on them too. Nice to know someone cares about them.</description>

      <description>Went to Odaiba some on Tuesday. It was mostly the Museum of Innovation and Technology we wanted to check out. For the robots and cool stuff. But to our surprise, they decided to close on Tuesdays! So we decided to just head to Sega Joypolis instead. Its an indoor theme park of games and stuff. Pretty cool, but doesn’t beat a proper theme park.
Odaiba is an artificial island (similar to the one in Dubai), built by the Japanese government during the economic boom some decade or two ago.</description>

      <description>Too lazy to get photos up today. Went to the senso-ji temple today. There was apparently a festival, using these badminton racquet things. Bought a DS USB charger and stylus so I can actually use my DS now! Prayed at a buddhist temple and got a fortune. It was perhaps the worst possible fortune ever. So I tied it on some stick thing so it will go away. Hope it does.</description>

      <description>Ahh the life of a Japanese local. My personal space was violated! Crushed against a sea of people. Though I am quite impressed, the entire mob moves at a very very brisk pace. If this was in Australia someone in front will randomly stop and the crowd’s movement will be screwed up.
Shibuya at night! It was packed with people. All the shops were closed so I assume they were going to clubs or bars or something.</description>

      <description>I’m really impressed with the Japanese train system. It goes absolutely EVERYWHERE! A lot of people that I know don’t even bother having cars, and just take the train everywhere. The cost is slightly higher than public transport usage in Perth, but you gotta pay for superiority.The main problem? The trains are so good, EVERYONE uses them. I took at train at peak hour to goto train at the Aunkai (an incredible martial art that requires another post on its own).</description>

      <description>We returned to Akihabara again, since it was the most interesting place. This time, however, we split up into smaller groups. Was very fun. Got souvenirs and talked to some pre-war guy who is an ukiyo-e printer/artist now. I wanted to buy some paintings but the ones I wanted were about 1000 AUD.
Shibuya was insanely packed. We went to what is apparently the biggest crosswalk in the world! My youtube channel has some videos.</description>

      <description>It hasn’t been that eventful for the past few days. Went to Ueno park and Ginza. We also went to an izakaya (Japanese bar), but we were told to go away. I’m assuming that they did not want foreigners but I’m really not sure. Interesting experience. Regardless, I managed to go to an izakaya the next night. More on that later.There are some pics of our visit to the zoo in this entry.</description>

      <description>After an hour of travelling on foot, we managed to reach the Ueno Park. Pretty cool. There was a buddhist shrine there!Here are some photos I took before we left. Cold and raining today. Chilling… This was taken from the rooftop of where I’m staying. A cemetary is so close by! A wall has been erected around the cemetary to scare people walking around it I suppose.
Not only that, here is a picture of the elevator.</description>

      <description>These are some photos when I visited Akihabara yesterday. Gotta love the train system here. Took almost no time to get there, and I assume its the same case for everywhere else. 11am. Friends still asleep. I think I’m going to kick them out of bed next time.
Apparently this car costs a million dollars. Not bad. Too scared to take a photo any closer in case the car’s owner has ninjas protecting it or something.</description>

      <description>Been up for the past 3 hours. Jet lag is kind to me. The only problem is that my friends are still asleep and I’m waiting for them to wake up. Next time I’ll just leave on my own or something.
Just went to Akihabara yesterday. Its insanely cool. There’s tech everywhere!Currently drinking this awful green tea/water mix thing. It tastes just like water, but you get a green tea aftertaste.</description>

      <description>Just arrived in Japan after a 12 hour flight. Good first impressions of Japan so far, insanely high density population and many many many train stops. Which is good… assuming you know where you’re going.
I’m in K’s Hostel at the moment. A very good place,., but this is the first hostel I’ve been to. Its like… Living with 50 other people. A weird experience, but not unwelcome. Good hostel though, its ranked the highest in Asia.</description>

      <description>Here are some photos I took initially.
…Real men take photos AFTER they finish their food.
First impressions in Japan? Interesting bathrooms (or lavatories, as the Americans call it). Every single toilet (well all the male ones as far as I know of course) have little baby seats, so you can stare at the baby while taking a dump I suppose.
Ahh an advanced toilet. What do these instructions lead to?</description>

      <description>On a plane with Victor, in the EXIT ROW!!! Quite spacy, with lots of leg room too. Hopefully for the next flight we’ll be on exit row as well, but I chose the squishy window seat instead, so I doubt I’ll get it.
Terrible night, hard to sleep. Had some red wine and scotch… on the rocks. Classy, but for someone with my nonexistent alcohol tolerance it overwhelms far too much.</description>

      <description>Hello there!
This blog will hopefully chronicle my adventures into the Land of the Rising Sun, depending if I can be bothered to keep it updated. This is my first blog, so please tolerate any violations of blogging ettiquette =)
I will be in California for a week, then Tokyo, Kyoto, Hakuba and Osaka. I leave this Friday on the 28th of November at around 11pm. It’ll be a 10 hour flight to Tokyo, 7 hour rest (!</description>
