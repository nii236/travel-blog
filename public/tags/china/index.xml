      <description>Tech stuff I love Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s airport express train&amp;rsquo;s progress bar.
One of the malls had seating areas which exist only to charge your phone. Its a great idea! Too bad my phone&amp;rsquo;s battery capacity is too big now, so these are useless to me.
Neat shops Ghibli Shop! Ghibli shops are great! The studio doesn&amp;rsquo;t make movies anymore (I think?) so its nice to see that the knick knacks are still being sold.</description>

      <description>This won&amp;rsquo;t be a daily blog, mostly because life in Hong Kong tends to blur into a big mush of stuff. So here are some highlights.
Food in Hong Kong! Service The workers here work at a breakneck pace, and I find myself constantly slowing everyone down. Its a lovely change from Malaysia. Here in Hong Kong, the service is bad because there are a billion people and so much to do.</description>

      <description>Hello again! Here we are in Hong Kong yet again. This is our third time here! I guess we never learn. Who would&amp;rsquo;ve thought that Hong Kong is not the most ideal place to relax and chill out.
Anyway might as well track our progress. When I&amp;rsquo;m 100 years old I&amp;rsquo;ll be saying wise words such as:
 Damn son, I was in Hong Kong 3 times by the time I was your age.</description>

      <description>Quack
Quack
Our new hostel. Pretty awesome. Outside looks horrible though so we were pretty worried at first
Steph relaxing on the new sofa. At least we get somewhere to sit this time
Reminds me Shibuya
Cool wire art
No idea what’s going on here. Beware wildlife perhaps?
Steph has been buying many cutesy socks and pants while here
Such compact! Doge approves
This dog was perfectly still and getting trimmed until another dog arrived and then they both went nuts</description>

      <description>I think this thing dispenses water
Horse sized duck and me with a duck face for scale
Pro gamers are so pro they need mechanical keyboards
Elite gamer shop! Had posters of pro players too
SHIN RAMYUN SOCKS! I wanted to buy these but no men’s sizing. I guess only women eat shin ramyun noodles.
Christmas is over, yet this treebread is not yet mouldy somehow
Yay no English. We somehow bought Lemon tea instead of bubble tea.</description>

      <description>Hot pot lunch/dinner. Can’t go wrong with Watami. It was great in Hong Kong too!
CALPIS ALCOHOL. My life is complete
Red bean McDonald’s apple pie. You know you’re in Asia when…
Really curious what was in here, I’ve seen a few of these around the place. Maybe some tarp and stuff?
They called this chitterlings. And there’s a Chinese dish called tempura that has nothing to do with Japanese tempura.</description>
