      <description>Deer-land! Deer everyone,
Today we went to Nara Park! Oh deer-ie me. I think I should stop with these lame puns or you, my precious reader, will decide to stop reading.
And we all know this blog needs more hits. I get like, one hit per year (hi Mum!).
I discovered an electric vehicle quick charging station!
I was scared to use this tap at the guesthouse. Who knows what each of those million dials could do.</description>

      <description>Nara! 奈良市! Big Temples and Stuff! Hello! We&amp;rsquo;ve finally landed in Japan. We&amp;rsquo;ve been to this country way too many times yet here we are! I think its because we&amp;rsquo;ve reached the point where going to Japan is just a comfortable process. We speak the language (terribly), and we can blend in (terribly)!
We took Malaysia Airlines this time to the country. The flights were cheaper and quite empty. I assume its because of the recent issues Malaysia Airlines have been having regarding keeping track of their planes, but seriously the flight was pretty good.</description>
