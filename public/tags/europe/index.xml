      <description>So here we are!
This is the last stop before heading back to Perth. We were in Barcelona for a few days (maybe four?).
Travel fatigue? In the fourth week of travel, we were getting pretty homesick. Either that or just too lazy to go anywhere. You can see this when we were very productive in Switzerland (our first stop), where we would move locations every day or two, do all sorts of stuff, explore the cities.</description>

      <description>London I don&amp;rsquo;t even know why there are still phoneboxes around.
We&amp;rsquo;re in London! We took the train to London from Paris! It took about 2.5 hours and we were terribly squished in the cabin. Not to mention people took our overhead storage space. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t very comfortable.
Holy crap look at that thing.
I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what building this is.
We stayed in Shoreditch, which was (allegedly) a really dodgy area but has been improved since.</description>

      <description>Paris! We&amp;rsquo;re in Paris! This city is absolutely massive compared to Amsterdam.
Its a christmas tree graveyard!
Walking a lot, then cruisin&amp;rsquo; On the first day we spent mostly walking around a lot. We walked from the Bastille area all the way to Notre Dame, all the way to the Louvre! I&amp;rsquo;m no walker so my legs were pretty shot by the end of the day.
There were no lines in Paris.</description>

      <description>Amsterdam! We&amp;rsquo;ve made it to Amsterdam! It&amp;rsquo;s the most tolerant of cities (or so I hear). Cycling friendly, and great views.
Getting bikes So apparently the Dutch are really big on their cycling friendly environment. We decided to get bikes of our own for this stay. We went to the closest bike rental but the guy didn&amp;rsquo;t speak any English! So we had to get by with common words between the two languages.</description>

      <guid>http://travel.niiteki.io/posts/2015/koln/</guid>
      <description>The idea was to stop by Koln on the way to Amsterdam as a stopover point, otherwise it&amp;rsquo;ll take way too long to get there! Good call I think, it took 4 hours to get here already. I&amp;rsquo;d rather not have to wait another 4 on the train!
Pssh.
For lunch we ate Vietnamese food. Not the most German of lunches, but I needed my fish sauce fix&amp;hellip;
German cuisine! Pho real.</description>

      <description>Karlsruhe We&amp;rsquo;ve made it to Germany! We&amp;rsquo;re in a small town called Karlsruhe.
A few years ago for her practicum, Steph made a friend who lived here.
Tea/Coffee We made it here after a 4 hour bus ride!
Cycle Tour Yesterday Steph&amp;rsquo;s friend showed us around the town. We had a look at various universities, and outdoor ice skating rink, and other things. Had dinner at a German pub.</description>

      <description>Before we head into Germany, we have a single night in Zurich.
The idea was to come to the city during Christmas and enjoy the Christmas markets. This plan completely failed though. Because the Christmas markets actually finish the day before Christmas!
So there we were in Zurich, all excited to experience the city. But the entire city was completely dead. The Swiss are apparently quite traditional, so everyone pretty much takes Christmas off.</description>

      <guid>http://travel.niiteki.io/posts/2015/sachseln/</guid>
      <description>Sachseln is a small town in the geographic centre of Switzerland. A big deal apparently! Only about 5000 people live here. There&amp;rsquo;s a big church and that&amp;rsquo;s about it really. The house we&amp;rsquo;re staying in is pretty amazing, super high tech facilities but also a traditional wooden house.
The view from the room
The house itself
Ancient latch system!
Swiss powerpoints confuse me.
This was mostly a stop between Jungraujoch and Zurich so we can get a decent rest.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in that photo, the tiny red speck.
The Top of Europe! Jungfraujoch is the tallest peak in Europe (or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been led to believe). So since we were both physically bad at hiking mountains and dealing with subzero temperatures, we thought it would be a good idea to go!
A pic from the top.
The Journey Actually getting to Jungfraujoch we very difficult and pretty much everything that could go wrong did (a common theory of mine).</description>

      <description>Gruyere So we&amp;rsquo;ve been eating this cheese called Gruyere cheese recently. It tastes kind of like an aged cheddar. Good stuff, and around 72 bucks a kilo back at home. Steph found out that there is a place in Switzerland called Gruyere, and they make that exact cheese! So of course we had to go.
The train took a couple of hours.
This was the only available public toilet in the town.</description>

      <description>Bern! We finally made it to Bern! Getting here was a lot more effort than you&amp;rsquo;d expect, mostly because of poor directions and getting hopelessly lost.
Cat Kingdom So the guy has a cat door, and random cats keep entering and leaving. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen two cats so far and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure there are way more.
I got nothing against cats. They&amp;rsquo;re cute and fluffy animal. But my allergies certainly don&amp;rsquo;t agree!</description>

      <description>Europe! (In 20 hours anyway) So I&amp;rsquo;m typing this while on the plane to Qatar.
Surprising that we got here on time considering we arrived late and pretty much everything that could&amp;rsquo;ve went wrong, did.
 Came late (normal) Check-in dude was really unfriendly (not normal) Check-in luggage got taken away for inspection Tax Refund Scheme took ages (AND it got rejected)  So yeah we were on the final call for boarding.</description>
