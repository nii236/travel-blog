      <description>Quack
Quack
Our new hostel. Pretty awesome. Outside looks horrible though so we were pretty worried at first
Steph relaxing on the new sofa. At least we get somewhere to sit this time
Reminds me Shibuya
Cool wire art
No idea what’s going on here. Beware wildlife perhaps?
Steph has been buying many cutesy socks and pants while here
Such compact! Doge approves
This dog was perfectly still and getting trimmed until another dog arrived and then they both went nuts</description>

      <description>I think this thing dispenses water
Horse sized duck and me with a duck face for scale
Pro gamers are so pro they need mechanical keyboards
Elite gamer shop! Had posters of pro players too
SHIN RAMYUN SOCKS! I wanted to buy these but no men’s sizing. I guess only women eat shin ramyun noodles.
Christmas is over, yet this treebread is not yet mouldy somehow
Yay no English. We somehow bought Lemon tea instead of bubble tea.</description>

      <description>Hot pot lunch/dinner. Can’t go wrong with Watami. It was great in Hong Kong too!
CALPIS ALCOHOL. My life is complete
Red bean McDonald’s apple pie. You know you’re in Asia when…
Really curious what was in here, I’ve seen a few of these around the place. Maybe some tarp and stuff?
They called this chitterlings. And there’s a Chinese dish called tempura that has nothing to do with Japanese tempura.</description>
