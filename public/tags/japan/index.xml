      <description>Miyajima Day 2 Damn today was extremely hot and humid. I felt like I was having a bath, except with clothes on and while standing. The overly accommodating but creepy Minshuku owner gave us paper fans, which was probably the most useful equipment that we&amp;rsquo;ve had this entire trip.
It was nice to have a change of scenery from the city, although it was only for two days. By the end of the day, we were looking forwards to returning back to civilisation.</description>

      <description>Miyajima Ok here we go. Itsukushima island (yes I know I just said Itsuku-island Island).
The home of the killer deer apparently. They will go through your bags and stuff. I better bring a baseball bat&amp;hellip;
Oh. Never mind.
This is all future tense of course. We&amp;rsquo;re currently on a rocket ship on rails known as the Shinkansen!
I always get a kick out of going in one. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the Nozomi, which is the express Shinkansen.</description>

      <description>Homestay Masterchef Steph learnt to cook some tamagoyaki today! The host mother was happy to teach.
I think it turned out okay, it tasted good. But then again, eggs are always da best!
Those mini sausages were also very tasty! 
Kobe City Today we decided to go ahead and explore the city in Kobe. It was HOT! Not hot hot, but sticky, humid hot. We don&amp;rsquo;t know why everyone was complaining that yesterday was hot, when it was miserable, raining and cool.</description>

      <title>Japan-Korea Day 3 - Himeji Castle</title>

      <description>First day in Kobe &amp;hellip;which didn&amp;rsquo;t actually have anything to do with Kobe 
Step 1. Find some suitable clothing It has been overcast and raining pretty much non-stop since we got here. This was never the plan really, as Steph only packed 8kg full of short shorts, tank-tops, and thin blouses. Everyone else in Himeji is walking around in jeans, jackets, raincoats and boots, so she felt really out of place.</description>

      <description>Deer-land! Deer everyone,
Today we went to Nara Park! Oh deer-ie me. I think I should stop with these lame puns or you, my precious reader, will decide to stop reading.
And we all know this blog needs more hits. I get like, one hit per year (hi Mum!).
I discovered an electric vehicle quick charging station!
I was scared to use this tap at the guesthouse. Who knows what each of those million dials could do.</description>

      <description>Nara! 奈良市! Big Temples and Stuff! Hello! We&amp;rsquo;ve finally landed in Japan. We&amp;rsquo;ve been to this country way too many times yet here we are! I think its because we&amp;rsquo;ve reached the point where going to Japan is just a comfortable process. We speak the language (terribly), and we can blend in (terribly)!
We took Malaysia Airlines this time to the country. The flights were cheaper and quite empty. I assume its because of the recent issues Malaysia Airlines have been having regarding keeping track of their planes, but seriously the flight was pretty good.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re heading to Japan and Korea next week! Exciting. Except for the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s going to rain like crazy for the entire time we are there, only to clear up into beautiful skies as soon as we leave.</description>

      <description>Today we rode our bikes around. Tried to go to ryougoku by bike. Took ages but it was closed when we got there! Very disappointing, was looking forward to eat sumo food. Not so I can get fat(ter) or anything. Just that it’s one of those foods that people don’t know about. Maybe it tastes awful?
We then went to Shinjuku in the evening. Kabukicho had a pretty DODGY vibe to it so we didn’t stay long.</description>

      <description>Aaand we are back in Japan. I suppose it was going to happen eventually.
This time around will be Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, but this time we will be adding Takayama to the list. Popular vacation town in the middle of the mountains somewhere. As luck would have it a volcano erupted there recently. Luckily the winds a blowing the ash in the other direction so we should be good.</description>
