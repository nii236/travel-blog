      <description>I’m alive!
Thursday
After getting a place to sleep in, I felt the lovely, lovely embrace of a bed. Quite a lot has happened in the past few days. Thursday night was the first Lindy event that I attended. It was great fun! The only problem was that there was actually zero space. Kept bumping into people. Not to mention that due to the lack of space, there wasn’t enough oxygen to go around.</description>
