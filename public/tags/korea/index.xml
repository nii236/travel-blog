      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re heading to Japan and Korea next week! Exciting. Except for the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s going to rain like crazy for the entire time we are there, only to clear up into beautiful skies as soon as we leave.</description>

      <description>Jeonju! The City of Gastronomy! I’m guessing that means they have tasty food there. Lets see shall we…
This blog post covers two days in Jeonju, it was an overnight stay at a traditional style room, complete with rock hard thin mattresses, sleeping on the floor, and heatpiped flooring (amazing!)
So old yet so new (the place just recently finished with renovations actually)
This is an image of outside the room.</description>

      <description>GANGNAM STYLE! We went to Gangnam today just because we could. Big regret, didn’t know what to do, where to go. Turns out its a huge district, and the actual tourist places aren’t at Gangnam station, they’re at Gangnam district! So you have to stop at another subway stop.
Regardless we pushed on to the Kukkiwon Taekwondo Headquarters. Its like the pilgramage I didn’t plan to do.
 …Too bad it sucked.</description>

      <description>Woof! We tried to go to another dog cafe this time (last time was in Busan if you remember). The first attempt was very disappointing, filthy, and mostly consisted of toy dogs yapping in your face constantly. We decided to give it another go as other online blogs have promising pictures.
In the end, it was the right decision to make. Giant wolf dogs abound!
…In fact, I think we accidentally went to a wolf cafe, not a dog cafe.</description>

      <description>These last few days weren’t that particularly exciting. They mostly involved shopping, eating, learning how to cook, or just sleeping. But that’s the best kind of holiday for us. Though there was a pretty awesome place we went to the following day…
Our new hostel is in the Honggik university area which was fantastic. Young culture and stuff. Did some shopping in the neighbouring Ehwa Women’s University area. Strangely enough there were mostly women’s clothing there, of a more preppy variety.</description>

      <description>We had a late morning as we wanted to enjoy the ridiculous amount of space we had in the hotel. Went back to the hostel sheepishly to grab some stuff for the day.
Today we had tickets to the Nanta cooking show. It’s one of Korea’s biggest tourist shows apparently. I can see why, it was really good! Very amusing show.
We went to myeongdong after that and it was pretty cool.</description>

      <description>Master chef Nii and lowly kitchen minion StephCooking! We did some cooking classes in the morning and it was pretty good. I’m not much of a chef but at least the assistants there clean up after me so it takes out the worst part of cooking.
Morning class: 3 kinds of BBQ Afternoon class: spicy chicken stew and japchae
More spicy food! Always spicy food :(Two cooking classes in a row!</description>

      <description>Hello again! We took the KTX to Seoul today. The bullet train is awesome! Makes you see how much further Perth has to go with regards to public transport. Actually that’s not fair, the South Korean transit system is probably world class. But it’s remarkably similar to every other subway in Asia, so I’m guessing there is one consultant somewhere who is making absolutely oodles of money selling his subway design skills.</description>

      <description>This is our last full day in Busan. We went to the beach, aquarium and puppy cafe.
Haundae beach was recommended by a friend but I guess I forgot that neither myself nor steph care about these beach things. I think I’ve been to the beaches in Perth less than 10 times over my short life so far.
Anyway it was pretty empty and no one was actually swimming. It might have been because of the extremely cold temperatures, or maybe the Koreans hate swimming like me!</description>

      <description>Well hello there! This is our first time in South Korea (not Best Korea). We’ve been in Busan for three days and I’m writing this as I’m on the bullet train to Seoul.
Day 1 mostly consisted of us sleeping the whole day and recovering from the plane trip. I feel like an old man sometimes.
This country is remarkably similar to Taiwan and Japan. The people are much louder, and a lot worse at staying on their side of the footpath.</description>
