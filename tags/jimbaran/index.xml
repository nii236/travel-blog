      <description>Our trusty host, Made, helped us get the scooter back.
He also makes us breakfast!
I rode on the back of his scooter and he took me to the Ayana Rimba Resort. I was worried that we&amp;rsquo;d get lost again, and guess what? We got lost! No problem though, more friendly villager types helped us out and we managed to get my scooter.
We grabbed some petrol on the way back.</description>

      <description>Simple 15 Minute Trip The accomodation here is amazing! Made is a superhost, meaning that you really can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with this place.
We rented a scooter.
This evening we had a traditional Balinese dance at the Ayana resort, unfortunately Google Maps has failed us!
![Google Maps directions]()
Do NOT take this route, you&amp;rsquo;ll die!
It was a beaten track, muddy, rocky, tree roots everywhere and we thought we were gonna die.</description>
