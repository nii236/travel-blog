      <description>This is our last full day in Busan. We went to the beach, aquarium and puppy cafe.
Haundae beach was recommended by a friend but I guess I forgot that neither myself nor steph care about these beach things. I think I’ve been to the beaches in Perth less than 10 times over my short life so far.
Anyway it was pretty empty and no one was actually swimming. It might have been because of the extremely cold temperatures, or maybe the Koreans hate swimming like me!</description>

      <description>Well hello there! This is our first time in South Korea (not Best Korea). We’ve been in Busan for three days and I’m writing this as I’m on the bullet train to Seoul.
Day 1 mostly consisted of us sleeping the whole day and recovering from the plane trip. I feel like an old man sometimes.
This country is remarkably similar to Taiwan and Japan. The people are much louder, and a lot worse at staying on their side of the footpath.</description>
