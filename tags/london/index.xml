      <description>London I don&amp;rsquo;t even know why there are still phoneboxes around.
We&amp;rsquo;re in London! We took the train to London from Paris! It took about 2.5 hours and we were terribly squished in the cabin. Not to mention people took our overhead storage space. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t very comfortable.
Holy crap look at that thing.
I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what building this is.
We stayed in Shoreditch, which was (allegedly) a really dodgy area but has been improved since.</description>
