      <description>Today we rode our bikes around. Tried to go to ryougoku by bike. Took ages but it was closed when we got there! Very disappointing, was looking forward to eat sumo food. Not so I can get fat(ter) or anything. Just that it’s one of those foods that people don’t know about. Maybe it tastes awful?
We then went to Shinjuku in the evening. Kabukicho had a pretty DODGY vibe to it so we didn’t stay long.</description>

      <description>Aaand we are back in Japan. I suppose it was going to happen eventually.
This time around will be Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, but this time we will be adding Takayama to the list. Popular vacation town in the middle of the mountains somewhere. As luck would have it a volcano erupted there recently. Luckily the winds a blowing the ash in the other direction so we should be good.</description>
