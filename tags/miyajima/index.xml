      <description>Miyajima Day 2 Damn today was extremely hot and humid. I felt like I was having a bath, except with clothes on and while standing. The overly accommodating but creepy Minshuku owner gave us paper fans, which was probably the most useful equipment that we&amp;rsquo;ve had this entire trip.
It was nice to have a change of scenery from the city, although it was only for two days. By the end of the day, we were looking forwards to returning back to civilisation.</description>

      <description>Miyajima Ok here we go. Itsukushima island (yes I know I just said Itsuku-island Island).
The home of the killer deer apparently. They will go through your bags and stuff. I better bring a baseball bat&amp;hellip;
Oh. Never mind.
This is all future tense of course. We&amp;rsquo;re currently on a rocket ship on rails known as the Shinkansen!
I always get a kick out of going in one. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the Nozomi, which is the express Shinkansen.</description>
