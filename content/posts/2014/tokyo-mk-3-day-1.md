Aaand we are back in Japan. I suppose it was going to happen eventually.

This time around will be Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, but this time we will be adding Takayama to the list. Popular vacation town in the middle of the mountains somewhere. As luck would have it a volcano erupted there recently. Luckily the winds a blowing the ash in the other direction so we should be good.

![image](/images/2014/10/wpid-img_20140929_154819-resized-1024.jpg)I really missed this drink. But I find I'm already getting sick of it. Uhoh...

![image](/images/2014/10/wpid-img_20140929_205432-resized-1024.jpg)Came across an arcade that seemed to be exclusively rhythm games! Heaven? You be the judge.
