We had a late morning as we wanted to enjoy the ridiculous amount of space we had in the hotel. Went back to the hostel sheepishly to grab some stuff for the day.

Today we had tickets to the Nanta cooking show. It’s one of Korea’s biggest tourist shows apparently. I can see why, it was really good! Very amusing show.

We went to myeongdong after that and it was pretty cool. It was basically what we were expecting Korea to be, a big sprawling shopping area packed with people. Capitalism at its finest, mwahahah! I got a pretty sweet backpack too.

This snail cream is apparently all the rage these days in Korea. I’m more curious about how they make it. Do they get people to follow snails around and collect their snail trail? Do they put snails through a grinder? Why do I seem to be the only person asking these important questions?

Not important enough, as steph ended up buying one as her grandma requested in. We got bucket loads self freebies and I even got some male BB cream! In no time at all I too shall look like Some Dong (or Samdong or whatever his name is). Steph tells me his name is Kim Soo Hyun, and he is now the poster boy for male Korean cosmetics.

This is a photo of me after only a few days of applying the said cream.

Korean bible bashers! They were preaching about something pretty serious sounding.

Puppets! These were pretty cool, looked like they were dancing without the assistance of strings. I actually couldn’t work out how it was done. Legs weren’t attached to the floor, no visible cables.

Korean stuff is too cute. I think these items are reaching the limits of practicality.

What’s this? Chips for ants?

Today was a shopping day, and was a lot better than the spicy food, epic  bowel movement day yesterday.
