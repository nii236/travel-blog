Today we rode our bikes around. Tried to go to ryougoku by bike. Took ages but it was closed when we got there! Very disappointing, was looking forward to eat sumo food. Not so I can get fat(ter) or anything. Just that it’s one of those foods that people don’t know about. Maybe it tastes awful?

We then went to Shinjuku in the evening. Kabukicho had a pretty DODGY vibe to it so we didn’t stay long. Man it was packed in there.

I... Think... These separate your toes while walking or something?

Empty boats makes it look scenic. I wonder of they're actually being used

Who needs more kids when you can just have midget dogs! They even wagged their tails in unison

Finally made it. The one true purpose of coming to Japan.

And there it is! Honestly, it tastes kind of like a normal burger. Smells slightly different though.

What a cool job! I'd probably get sick of it after the thousandth shift though

I... Think... This is a book on how women can socialise better. Anyone?
