This is our last full day in Busan. We went to the beach, aquarium and puppy cafe.

Haundae beach was recommended by a friend but I guess I forgot that neither myself nor steph care about these beach things. I think I’ve been to the beaches in Perth less than 10 times over my short life so far.

Anyway it was pretty empty and no one was actually swimming. It might have been because of the extremely cold temperatures, or maybe the Koreans hate swimming like me!

We read that it’ll be packed and you’ll be jam packed with aunties and whatever else. Not the case with this beach trip. Too cold probably, the only group there with any real presence were lots and lots of kids there on a field trip.

We came all this way so we decided we might as well go to the aquarium as well. Not much else to do here! The best show was meant to be the shark feeding event but we missed that unfortunately.

Funnily enough the highlight of our trip to the beach was finding a nice kitchen ware store! You know you’re getting old when buying a water jug fills you with more satisfaction than electronics or something. Lots of cool stainless steel products, pots and pans. Sigh maturity is never cool.

Not sure why but I was feeling pretty bad on this day, puked the days contents and felt slightly better after. I suspect it’s the giant slimy sashimi lunch we had the day before.

Went to eat dinner at the pork bbq place yet again. Good stuff. Same staff seemed happy to see us. We’re regulars!

We went to a dog cafe. And no it doesn’t involve eating dogs, rather playing with puppies (filthy, dirty animals) while eating.
