Before we head into Germany, we have a single night in Zurich.

The idea was to come to the city during Christmas and enjoy the Christmas markets. This plan completely failed though. Because the Christmas markets actually finish *the day before Christmas*!

So there we were in Zurich, all excited to experience the city. But the entire city was completely dead. The Swiss are apparently quite traditional, so everyone pretty much takes Christmas off. Even the hotel restaurant was closed! What were we meant to eat!

I had to walk around until I found some kebab shops that were still open!

So there we were on Christmas eve, eating kebabs and watching Home Alone on TV.
