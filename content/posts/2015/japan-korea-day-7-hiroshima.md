# Peace Park

Hiroshima is famous for being the first place in human history to be targeted for the atomic bomb.

Half of the museum was closed for renovation! I think this is the third time we've been hit with this "unexpected maintenance" thing.

# Hiroshima style okonomiyaki!

Hiroshima is _also_ famous for its regional okonomiyaki! Its your typical okonomiyaki, but more noodle-y.
