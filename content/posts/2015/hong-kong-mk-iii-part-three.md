# Tech stuff
![train progress bar](/images/2015/10/airport_express_progress_bar.jpg)
I love Hong Kong's airport express train's progress bar.

![usb seats](/images/2015/10/usb_charger_seats.jpg)

One of the malls had seating areas which exist only to charge your phone. Its a great idea! Too bad my phone's battery capacity is too big now, so these are useless to me.

# Neat shops
## Ghibli Shop!

Ghibli shops are great! The studio doesn't make movies anymore (I think?) so its nice to see that the knick knacks are still being sold. But man, one of the clocks in there were available for 700AUD! 700! Goddamn, that better be one unbelievably useful clock. Like, it better tell the time and stuff.

# Buildings
![City skyline grid](/images/2015/10/buildings.jpg)

This is a nice view of the city skyline from the Ocean Terminal. Or Harbour City. I'm not really sure what its called, there are like three department stores mushed together into one super store.

Note the (literally) breathtaking pollution and smog.

# Other weird things

I found him!

This guys gig was REALLY REALLY weird. I can't really explain it. The dude basically just builds random experimental musical instruments.

![Robot](/images/2015/10/kate_robot.jpg)

A really freaky robot who tried to be helpful. It wasn't helpful, though it took a photo of us so that wins some points.

# Other random things

![Misocool](/images/2015/10/misocool.jpg)

A shop with a lame pun.

![moomoo](/images/2015/10/moomoo.jpg)

A shop with a cute name. Cafe Moomoo!

![chocolate shop](/images/2015/10/shop.jpg)

Literally the only reason this photo exists is because I needed more photos of myself. I didn't even go in this shop.

![egg tarts](/images/2015/10/tai_cheong_eggtart.jpg)

The bag in my hands is a bunch of egg tarts from Tai Cheong Bakery. Not as good as the ones mentioned a few posts ago (that were bought from the excellently named Macau Yummy Yummy).

![typhoon](/images/2015/10/typhoon_sign.jpg)

This time around the typhoon level was only level 3. Nice and safe, unlike last time where the rain was biblical, man.
