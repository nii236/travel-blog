The idea was to stop by Koln on the way to Amsterdam as a stopover point, otherwise it'll take way too long to get there! Good call I think, it took 4 hours to get here already. I'd rather not have to wait another 4 on the train!

Pssh.

For lunch we ate Vietnamese food. Not the most German of lunches, but I needed my fish sauce fix...

There was a cute soft toy store which was apparently awesome.

Not only that, we found a Christmas market! Great! Even after Christmas too.

Some food from the market.

Apparently Koln is famous for it's cathedral, but the one in Strassbourg was way cooler I reckon.
