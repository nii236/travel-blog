I'm in that photo, the tiny red speck.

# The Top of Europe!

Jungfraujoch is the tallest peak in Europe (or so I've been led to believe). So since we were both physically bad at hiking mountains and dealing with subzero temperatures, we thought it would be a good idea to go!

# The Journey

Actually getting to Jungfraujoch we very difficult and pretty much everything that could go wrong did (a common theory of mine). I forgot my backpack, we had to wait long for transport, we missed trains, took wrong routes, etc etc. It was an extremely stressful day but we got there in the end!

300AUD later we have our tickets and got there eventually.

# Fellow Tourists

There were a LOT of Chinese tourists there and its pretty funny because pretty much every Swiss person has told us to expect this. So it was like being back in China, with noisy buses and luggages being pushed everywhere. I guess we would've been expected to be Chinese tourists too because of the way we look. We didn't run into any racial issues though.

# Pronounciation

So this entire time we've been pronouncing the 'J's incorrectly. Jungfraujoch has silent 'J's!

# Getting to the top!

So apparently the peak is 3400m above sea level or something. The views were great but we couldn't actually look at the views much because it was so damn cold up there.

We went outside, took some pics then ran back inside!

Grabbing some food before going up.

On the way up you actually take a train inside the mountain itself. There are stops along the way where they have installed windows into the side of the mountain so you can jump out for 5 minutes and look out from the mountain side. Its pretty cool!

# Afterward

After leaving for our next destination we realised that there was actually nothing to eat and nothing open! Desperate times, desperate measures. We ate the only thing available, which was Chinese food.

At Swiss prices, we probably paid 60 bucks for this food.
