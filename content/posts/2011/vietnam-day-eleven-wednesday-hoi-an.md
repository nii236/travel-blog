Wednesday. Got up in the morning and prepared for a flight to Hoi An. Got packed and then had breakfast. Tried to rush and get some nice photos printed out for tailoring but didn’t get around to it.

Took a flight to Danang. The tour guide was brilliant. Much better than any tour guide we have had so far. Makes me annoyed at the crappy tour guiding we’ve had for the past two locations.

Stopped by a marble sculpting place. Bought some cool marbley things.

Went into Hoi An. Nice small town. Checked into the hotel.

Went for a two hour walking tour around the old town. Went to the tailoring shops. Steph and I plan to get some clothes tailored. Its expensive by Vietnamese standards but about normal for Australian standards. We’ll try em on tomorrow so I hope it’ll fit okay. I’m getting two shirts, one pants and one jacket done. Steph is getting two pants, two dresses. Might look at the shoemakers later tomorrow after going to My Son ruins thing.

Finally got around to updating the blog.
