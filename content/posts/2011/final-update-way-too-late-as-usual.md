Final update for completeness! Like usual, I’ve gotten lazy in updating my status over the past week. My last trip was the same, I didn’t bother near the end of the trip either. Apparently its because I over blogged. Short snippets of updating is probably the best way to go. Note that this will be a retroactive update, since I’m actually back in Perth now! I’m just writing this as a way of closure I suppose.

**Kyoto**

Here for two days. Went to various temples and Eigamura, a themed area showing the historical buildings of Japan. It shows how period films in meiji/edo era were made. Pretty neat.

Tried cycling for a bit but Steph wasn’t experienced enough in cycling to go through the hostile landscape. Ended up meeting her after cycling around town as she took the bus. She got a bit lost and stressed out though. Ended up okay.

**Osaka**

Went cycling. Very cold. Snowing. I thought it was ash at first but it was snow! Little flecks just flying through the cold, cold air. Face was freezing because I didn’t have anything to cover it. I had to stop every now and then to stick my mouth and nose inside my jacket and to breath in my expelled air just to keep me warm… For some mysterious reason, I also got sick the next day! The illness plagued me for the rest of the journey.

I was cycling without Steph because she was feeling sick. Stumbling around the hotel and puking and stuff. I felt bad leaving her there, but I pretty much did everything I could already.

Ended up exploring the city. Not too much to look at to be honest. But I was in the scrums after all (no I don’t know what that means). I ended up riding all the way up and visiting Osaka’s Lindy Hoppers/Swing Dancers for a friendly night of dancing! It was nice to be able to interact with the locals.

**Hakuba**

Snowboarding! Not much to say really. Great fun. Painful. Cold. Lots of snow. I got stuck underneath powder for awhile. Tried snowboarding over but it was about 1m of loose powder! Had to dig myself out and that took about 5 to 10 minutes. Quite scary up there too because of zero visibility and snow storms etc.

Steph had a go on the ski boards. After a lot of initial frustration and vents (as usual) she eventually got the hang of it. We went up the ski lifts and I gave her a nice push down. She didn’t know how to stop though so she kept accelerating all the way down! I couldn’t keep up with her. Luckily she didn’t slam into anybody though. But she really needs to get that hockey stop thing working.

We ate at a nice bar too. Canadatei. Lots of rowdy Australians (!) there. Next evening we ate at a pizza place. Very small servings so we were left hungry.

**Tokyo**

The main city. Some pretty interesting stuff happened here.

Went to Shinjuku, Akihabara and Shibuya. Not too much point really, going to all these shopping places (+Hong Kong) when Steph doesn’t like shopping in the first place.

Went to Disneyland. Lots of walking. Lots of waiting in line (2 or 3 hour waits) since the fast passes were not available for some mysterious reason. It was pretty cold too. After the Ocean Park Theme Park in Hong Kong, most of the thrill rides in Disneyland were pretty tame to be honest. I was just sitting there bored. But its all a matter of perspective. In Hong Kong I was clinging on for dear life and terrified for my safety. In a good way.

Went to Harajuku, Akihabara and Asakusa. Great food stores in Harajuku. We didn’t see the famed cosplayers hanging around the bridge though. Not sure. It was raining a bit. Bought various souvenirs today too. Ultra high tech nail clippers (!), headphones, food etc.

**Malaysia**

Stayed for one night. Pretty interesting country. At least they have cheap accomodation! We stayed in a 5 star hotel!

The Malays are much ruder than I expected. Eye rolling, unsmiling arrogant attitudes etc. The Indian and Chinese-Malaysians were pretty cool though.

Met up with Russell. Helped us around the hostile environment so that was really appreciated. Ate at a really dodgy but authentic Malaysian food court. Tasty food too! Lots of foreigners, much more than I expected.

Went to Kinokuniya. Its a Japanese bookstore! I finally found my Picross puzzle books. I looked all over Japan for them and yet here they are in Malaysia instead -_-.

Cool shops everywhere. Very geared towards tourists though so the prices weren’t that good.
