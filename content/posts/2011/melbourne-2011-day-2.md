Got up early (well 10am isn’t THAT early) to transfer to another hostel. Took the tram then train to South Yarra. We’ll be here at this hostel for a week or so. Its a lot worse than I remember. Poor service, crappy rooms, slow cleaners (one hour late waiting to check in)  etc.

Went to the city to walk around but everything is closed! Luckily all the Chinese places were open. Ate asian food and explored Chinatown. Nothing of real interest happened here.
