Hi all, Sorry for not updating many pics lately. The internet is very poor here and its difficult to write words, let alone upload pictures with this poor system. I’ll get some videos of me stacking it later.These pics are of snowboarding last week. It was really fun, yet painful. It wasn’t that cold either, because you work out alot while snowboarding. However when you head inside the rest house to take a break you start becoming super cold as your body temperature goes down from resting.

![](/travel-blog/images/2010/10/dscf0127.jpg)I finally discovered the mega mac! Its on top of a mountain at that, and is no where to be found in Tokyo or Osaka. A rare find. It wasn’t very pleasant though, basically a big mac with 4 meat patties.
