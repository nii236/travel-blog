We returned to Akihabara again, since it was the most interesting place. This time, however, we split up into smaller groups. Was very fun. Got souvenirs and talked to some pre-war guy who is an ukiyo-e printer/artist now. I wanted to buy some paintings but the ones I wanted were about 1000 AUD.

Shibuya was insanely packed. We went to what is apparently the biggest crosswalk in the world! My youtube channel has some videos. Iâ€™ll upload some more pics later.
