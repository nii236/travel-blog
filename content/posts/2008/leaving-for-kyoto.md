Hi all,

We’re gonna be leaving for Kyoto later today. The place we’re staying at is kindof dodgy actually, its 40 minutes away from the city centre and has a curfew. Plus it looks like a giant complex of some sort. Its a youth hostel, rather than a backpackers hostel so I don’t really know what to expect. [Utano Youth Hostel link](http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/org/utano-yh/). Packing up now. Seeyou soon.
