On our last day in USA, we dropped by Hollywood. It took a lot of trouble to get there, and the public transport was pretty scary at night. Hollywood remains underwhelming, mostly because we just came from Las Vegas (the place of overwhelming stuff).[

This is the La Quinta hotel at LAX. Nice hotel, though very pricy. They use neat USB sticks as keys to open the doors.
