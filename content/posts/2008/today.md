Too lazy to get photos up today. Went to the senso-ji temple today. There was apparently a festival, using these badminton racquet things. Bought a DS USB charger and stylus so I can actually use my DS now! Prayed at a buddhist temple and got a fortune. It was perhaps the worst possible fortune ever. So I tied it on some stick thing so it will go away. Hope it does.

Discovered melon bread too. Pretty cool stuff. It was raining quite badly today, so I didn’t end up going out that much. I was hoping to goto Shibuya or Roppongi but the other guys weren’t very enthusiastic so I ended up dropping it.
