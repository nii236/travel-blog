![](/images/2010/10/dscf0019.jpg)Ahh the life of a Japanese local. My personal space was violated! Crushed against a sea of people. Though I am quite impressed, the entire mob moves at a very very brisk pace. If this was in Australia someone in front will randomly stop and the crowd’s movement will be screwed up.  

![](/images/2010/10/dscf0023.jpg)Shibuya at night! It was packed with people. All the shops were closed so I assume they were going to clubs or bars or something. We tried to follow the crowd but weren’t successful.

![](/images/2010/10/dscf00142.jpg)Japanese doors are too short for Victor! We don’t actually know where this door leads though, it was in a really seedy back alley.

![](/images/2010/10/dscf00091.jpg)Ahh, Yoshinoya can give you a lunch for less than 400 yen. It’s McDonalds for Japanese really. But healthier. With smaller servings.  
![](/images/2010/10/dscf0011.jpg)Lots of people smoking around a non smoking sign.  
![](/images/2010/10/dscf00081.jpg)Engrish bank.

I have no idea what this is. 
![](/images/2010/10/dscf00053.jpg)Random Japanese drink. Pretty tasty too! Tastes like Mountain Dew sortof.  
![](/images/2010/10/dscf00031.jpg)Seedy Akihabara…
