Just arrived at LA and the motel we’ll be staying at for the next few days. Kinda old, but livable. What’s more annoying is the fact that the XD card reader is not working. I can’t pull pictures out! I’ll have to buy a new reader or something when I return to Japan. We’ll be here for two days and then head off to Las Vegas. Most of our time here will be spent going to Disneyland and maybe Hollywood if we can afford the exorbitant taxi fares.

The traffic here is extremely bad and about 70% of the cars are four wheel drives. The smog is very prevalent and there is a lot of traffic and road rage. Many many people speak Spanish rather than English, which is quite interesting.
