Went snowboarding yesterday. Very humiliating, as I kept falling over. Also extremely painful for your wrist and tailbone. I couldn’t get up this morning becauase of how sore I was. But I am now awake and off to do it again. I should really take lessons, but I’m hoping all this youtube watching and forum reading will be enough =)

After 4 days of this stuff I should be pretty good I hope. It looks really fun… when you don’t constantly fall on your ass.
