Hello there!  
This blog will hopefully chronicle my adventures into the Land of the Rising Sun, depending if I can be bothered to keep it updated. This is my first blog, so please tolerate any violations of blogging ettiquette =)

I will be in California for a week, then Tokyo, Kyoto, Hakuba and Osaka. I leave this Friday on the 28th of November at around 11pm. It’ll be a 10 hour flight to Tokyo, 7 hour rest (!) in the airport then another 10 hour flight to Los Angeles.

Until then I will be shopping for gear that I may still need. This concludes my first test post. Until next time! =)
