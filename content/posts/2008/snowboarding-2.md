Completed another day of snowboarding. We were all meant to get up at 630am, but since we were all so tired from yesterday we ended up getting out of the house about 9 or 10am. Snowboarding was much more fun today, I managed to fall about 3/4 as much as yesterday. I’ve also learnt to fall on different parts of my body, so by the end of the week my entire body should be manageable. Right now my tail bone and bum is bruised. Sounds funny doesn’t it? You won’t think so after snowboarding.

Regardless its pretty fun, once you get going. I’m still learning how to turn on the toeside of the board (heelside is okay) and that will take another day or two I reckon. Once I get those two down, I should be relatively okay. I just found out the board actually flexes, so putting the board under torsional flex (torquing it in different directions with either leg) allows turning. It beats falling down at each turn and getting back up like I’ve been doing so far.

Bechtel just sent me an email, saying I get a trip to Brisbane for my graduate induction program. Sweet! Hope its not brutally hard, such as they making me run on a treadmill for 6 hours or something. Or worse, talk to people.
