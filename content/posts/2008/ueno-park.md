After an hour of travelling on foot, we managed to reach the Ueno Park. Pretty cool. There was a buddhist shrine there!Here are some photos I took before we left. Cold and raining today.

![](/images/2010/10/dscf0009.jpg)A temple at Ueno park. Some monks were inside idling by. Probably waiting for clueless tourists or something.

![](/images/2010/10/dscf00141.jpg)This is closer up to the temple. You are apparently meant to write your wishes on the paper things and put them up with the others. Apparently a supernatural power will grant said wishes.

![](/images/2010/10/dscf00163.jpg)The cherry tree here is bandaged up for some reason. I have no idea why. Maybe it was hurt.  
![](/images/2010/10/dscf0017.jpg)Peak hour in Ueno.  
![](/images/2010/10/dscf0018.jpg)The local fish market! Well I call it a fish market but its a market of all sorts of other stuff as well (including lots of fish). The markets seems to consist of people shouting at passers by.
