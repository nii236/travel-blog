Currently on the bus back to LA from Las Vegas. I have no idea how the internet works on a moving bus, but I’m assuming it is a satellite internet connection or something. Very cool bus this one… It even has power points and little tables (such as those seen in planes) in addition to the standard TV. 2 days in LA then we’re off to Japan!
