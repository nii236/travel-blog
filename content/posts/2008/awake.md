Been up for the past 3 hours. Jet lag is kind to me. The only problem is that my friends are still asleep and I’m waiting for them to wake up. Next time I’ll just leave on my own or something.

Just went to Akihabara yesterday. Its insanely cool. There’s tech everywhere!Currently drinking this awful green tea/water mix thing. It tastes just like water, but you get a green tea aftertaste.
