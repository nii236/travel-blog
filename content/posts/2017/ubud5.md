# Being a tourist

Today was the day we decided to do all the touristy stuff.

# Goa Gajah

Also known as the elephant cave. Its a half buddhist half hindi temple. Wasn't that interesting honestly. Also my legs were absolutely killing me so I didn't want to walk anymore stairs than I have to.

# Lunch at Bebek Tempi Sewak (?)

I had bebek betutu here for the first time. It is a tasty smoked duck, something to do with leaves and Balinese herbs.

# Taman Ayun

This place was completely empty which is sad considering It was just as decent as the next place.

# Tanah Lot

This place was absolutely tourist central! High fees, tourists everywhere, there were so many souvenir shops. It was also stinking hot and I believe I have gotten a shade darker after today.

# Seminyak

Finally we reach our next destination for accomodation, Seminyak!
