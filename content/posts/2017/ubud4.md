Today was the Elephant Safari Tour!

Unfortunately we had to get up at 5:45am, which was kind of ridiculous. Anyway the driver picked us up in a 12 seater bus. Its actually pretty amazing how he navigated the squishy roads of Ubud with such a huge vehicle.

We were hooning up and downhill, and around windy roads for an hour or so (I think we were almost drifting at some point) until we got to our destination.

We made it to the park in one piece some how.

First step was to wash the elephants.

Second step was the swim with the elephants.

The showers we had after that were heavenly. Its been a LONG time since I've had a shower with hot water AND high pressure.

Next was breakfast. I miss Western food so I made sure to get my moneys worth of the buffet!

Elephant ride was next. We got to speak to one of the mahouts, who is a one to one elephant trainer and all round elephant buddy. Turns out he came over to Bali from Sumatra with the elephant.

Finally was the elephant show.
