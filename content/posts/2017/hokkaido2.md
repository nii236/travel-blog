So this post is all about our road trip around Hokkaido! We didn't get too far east (apparently bears are everywhere) so we didn't run into too many problems. 

## Photo Dump!

### Daisetsuzan

This is the onsen at the place we stayed at in Daisetsuzan. 

I wanted a good drone pic of the accomodation but it was raining too heavily.

It looks sorta ominous here but its quite nice

### Furano

We had a pretty crappy accomodation here, but it was only for a night and it was the cheapest one we could find.

View from the room:

### Tomamu

Ramen! I think this was at the base of unkai terrace at the Hoshino resort.

Unkai is a Japanese term meaning "sea of clouds", which is what you see when you take the ropeway to the mountain. It was closed when we got there unfortunately so here is an image I ripped from a website.

We also took some sweet drone footage of the area. 


### Chitose

We made it to the Khaosan Chitose Family Hostel. This accommodation was really nice actually, so much better than Furano the night before.

Steph (and I afterwards) enjoying our first kotatsu. It was as amazing as the legends say. A kotatsu is a table with a heavy futon blanket on the sides, and a heating element underneath.

We went to an izakaya in Chitose after our road trip.

### Atsuma

On the way, we visited Atsuma, in the middle of nowhere. As you can see, one of the most exciting things is this train sign in the middle of 
nowhere also.

We tried desperately to get a postcard for this place, but they only had a blank white piece of cardboard with a post code in front.

Jigokudani! This is hell's valley. Basically a sulfur pit with rotten egg smells everywhere.

Next we checked into the super onsen/ryokan, Dai-Ichi Takimotokan. This place was 300 bucks a night, but it was pretty amazing. The onsen is the main draw of it I think. 7 onsen, simulated waterfalls, temperatures ranging from 38 to 43 degrees, sauna, sulphur sauna, outdoor baths.

That evening we had kaiseki diner, all the fancy pants Japanese fine dining. It was a little too much seafood and a little too much potato for us actually. But still, a fun experience.

The next morning was the buffet. Somehow it had the best croissants ever! Maybe second best after the home baked ones in Berne.

### Hakodate

Hakodate was our final drive stop. Small city, everything is really walkable actually and I really liked it here.

There's a famous burger place called Lucky PIerrot's in Hakodate. It was not bad, nothing mind blowing.

We talk the ropeway to hakodateyama, the mountain nearby.

I had whale bacon for the first time. It took many attempts to find it but I can now say that I've tried it and its not worth it. It tastes like really chewy fish.

Even the police cars are really cute here.

The next day we went to the red brick warehouses, and bought a bunch of souvenirs.
