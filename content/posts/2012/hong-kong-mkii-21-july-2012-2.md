Breakfast at Tsui Wah next to our hostel. Really bad compared to the same restaurant over at the Galaxy Casino in Macau. Probably because that was at the Galaxy Casino and this time was in the Mirador Mansion slums. Maybe. Regardless, food took ages to arrive, drinks forgotten (seriously, what’s with that? I think about 5 times now service staff have forgotten to give me my drinks. Maybe people don’t order drinks or something?). Steph’s food, which was the cheese rice seafood bake thing or something, arrived poorly presented and the seafood was OFF! Smelled rotten. She ate a bite by accident before realising. Not a pleasant experience. Not to mention the food took ages to arrive. I, however, was guiltily chomping away happily at my condensed milk bun and brown chicken.

Walked around TST for awhile, got some belts. Chilled out in the LAN cafe for an hour waiting for our massage appointment to arrive (2pm I think it was). This was when I uploaded all my photos online to Google+. Pretty cheap ends up being 20HKD for an hour for two people. This works out to about half the price of LAN cafes in Perth. Not that anyone really goes to LAN Cafes anymore.

Went to the (strangely Japanese centric) massage place. Costed quite a bit but I was too scared to go to the dodgy basement ones that were advertised everywhere in TST. I’ve heard horror stories of 100% surcharges or just price hikes and fine print, enforced by burly men (or at least men with pointy sticks). Maybe. So we decided to pay through the nose.

It was pretty cool experience. Chinese Massage. And by cool I mean GODDAMN IT WAS PAINFUL. That damn lady probably had a big grin on her face as she poked, prodded, crushed, pinched and elbowed me everywhere. Meanwhile I gritted my teeth through the worst of it. And the best of it. Some nice moments during that massage, which were punctuated pleasantly by death grips and painful stabs.

Foot massage after was pretty neat though. I have pretty big feet so I get more value for money than Steph! Mwahaha!

We’ve been doing that every day so far. Go out, nap, go out. Not sure if that’s really healthy but it seems to work. Maybe that’s what everyone else does too. Though it still makes me wonder, doesn’t everyone work? How the hell do these people afford to shop and eat out ALL THE DAMN TIME?! I’m sure there are a bunch of professionals working 9am – 9pm, but that leaves the other 10 million Chinese people I see running around and pushing the economy forward at a ridiculous speed.

Ahem. Anyway ate dinner in Ootoya. Felt like some Japanese food. It as pretty damn good! Drank some lovely Calpis Soda, my favourite drink of all.  

![image](/travel-blog/images/2012/07/wpid-img_20120721_205009.jpg "IMG_20120721_205009.jpg")Very good and pretty affordable as well.

Grabbed some preserved red dates for Mum. I’m a little concerned because there is no English label on them, making it difficult to bring into Australia. I might need to buy it again elsewhere that is more foreigner friendly so Australian Customs don’t beat me up when I land in Perth for smuggling mysterious Chinese drugs.

![image](/travel-blog/images/2012/07/wpid-img_20120721_213800.jpg "IMG_20120721_213800.jpg")Looks tasty. Grabbed some drinks from 7/11. Man I should be doing this more often. I love trying out random Asian drinks but the ones here in Hong Kong are nowhere near as good as the ones in Japan.  

![image](/travel-blog/images/2012/07/wpid-img_20120721_220953.jpg "IMG_20120721_220953.jpg")Found a dessert place. Dessert hunting was our original plan today. Spaghetti grass jelly! 

Steph wasn’t feeling too flash (maybe from the bad seafood this morning) so I let her rest and headed to Mongkok on my own. Walked around for a bit then as I was walking through the markets saw everyone closing up. Everyone else was leaving! I wondered why then felt a massive gust of wind.

![image](/travel-blog/images/2012/07/wpid-img_20120721_171122.jpg "IMG_20120721_171122.jpg")Discovered dessert shop. Need to try this place later.

![image](/travel-blog/images/2012/07/wpid-img_20120721_171726.jpg "IMG_20120721_171726.jpg")Tempting. Mass produced char kwe/chow wai/crusty flour roll things in Perth are no good. Must try before I leave The typhoons are starting! Typhoon warning level 1 has been issued. We should be grateful that we’ve gotten an entire week so far without rain though, instead receiving suffocating humidity and pollution. Beats rain any day. Mostly because I’m not really equipped for upside down rivers pouring on my head.

I tried to dash to the MTR (train system subway thing) but took a wrong turn and got lost. Hid in a shop for awhile then eventually found it. Just had to follow the sea of people. And I MEAN a sea of people. Damn it was peaker than peak hour. I took a video of it. It was that noteworthy. The crowding that is, not the typhoon. Typhoons are meh. At level 1 anyway.
