Late morning. Got up at 930am. Well I suppose it’s not that late the highly industrious Cantonese folk work 10am to 10pm for some reason.

We need to get to Macau today since that’s where our next accomodation is. Not so easy getting there. In better news, no typhoon yet! No rain either. Maybe it’s because the millions of skyscrapers make it hard for the rain to get in. Dunno.
