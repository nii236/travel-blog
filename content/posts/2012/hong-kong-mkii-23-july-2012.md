Well as usual my update at the end of my holiday is very late! This blog post will cover 23 July onwards. The holiday was meant to finish on the 24th of July but we eventually delayed until the 25th I think.

Anyway the typhoon was going pretty crazy around now. The typhoon signals range from 1 to 10. Level 8 is pretty much danger level! Shops would close and people would be told to go home from work etc. I don’t really blame them, winds and rain were battering everything everywhere at level 8! At this point of the we were still going at a very cool level 3.

We decided to go to Mong Kok today. Returned to it because it was the most interesting place so far. We went to Langham place because the typhoon was too strong so we had to stay underground. So we woke up, bought an umbrella for emergencies at 7/11 then ran across the road to the subway entrance. This was our only time outside for now, otherwise we would’ve been killed by the flying debris.

Made it to Mongkok station, then used the underground connection to Langham Place. Gotta stay underground! Rain was everywhere! We ate some breakfast at Chee Kai. Crab congee again, it tasted really good! I think this is the second time we’ve had the same dish here heheh.

Decided this was our moment to use up all of our money so we took the lift to the top floor then slowly made our way down. This place is better than other department stores because they aren’t overpriced brand names or 1000 dollar shoes but rather normal small shops selling stuff.

The layout of the department store is pretty cool. The escalator takes you all the way to the top. You can’t take escalators between floors (not easily anyway, I never worked out how to do it), but instead you just walk around the place in a spiral and you’ll eventually go down floors.

While there Steph bought a cool watch which the shop assistant insisted many times about the quality of the item because its hand made in JAPAN. Japan is synonymous with ultra high quality with most Asians for some reason. Steph is skeptical and thinks the leather strap for the watch is going to snap pretty soon. We shall see.

We also found a shop that sells cutesypoo stuff. Lots of earmuffs, cushions, blankets and bags all in a cutesypoo theme, such as fluffy animals or furry thingoes. Steph really liked this store, and went away from it with two earmuffs and a blanket with a penguin face as an integrated pillow as well as some penguin feet. I myself bought a cool turtle pencil case looking thing.

I found a neat sack bag thing, which is ideal for bringing to the gym. A lot of people probably think it looks dinghy but I think it is cool and is anime styled like Naruto or something. Ninja looking sack bag. I’ve used it a few times and am pretty happy with it, it holds all my gym gear as well as my super duper olympic lifting shoes.

It was tricky at this point because we actually ran out of money! I miscalculated and didn’t realise this until it was too late. I tried to pull out money from the ATMs but they weren’t giving me any. This is why I hate relying on credit cards while travelling. After about three ATMs I finally tried another bank’s ATM (Bank of China in this case) with success! There is probably a ginormous surcharge for using it though. Never good to withdraw using credit cards.

Once we were done with Langham place we decided to head to the cool Argyle Centre again. This also required a quick dash across the typhoon rains. We made it in one piece though. Argyle Centre was cool but we never actually looked at the rest of the levels. I think there were about 3 or 4 floors in all. We tried to fix that this time around and was reasonably successful. Steph managed to get some decent clothing and bags amongst other stuff. The stuff here was geared towards women so I couldn’t really buy much here. I regret not buying more stuff at the Mongkok Computer Centre though.

I put earplugs in before going to sleep. I woke up to the storm to end all storms! Basically from the time I went to sleep and to the time I woke up the typhoon went up to level 8. Kind of sucks really this caused Air Asia to delay their flights, which will be discussed later, a terrible adventure that was.

We had nowhere to go at typhoon level 8 many shops are closed! I was a little worried, but apparently Hong Kong people were just happy to be able to leave work early. I had to scout around in the rain for a place to eat since we were both pretty hungry and then found out that the Tsui Wah restaurant was open 24/7, rain or shine… or typhoon! After the rotten seafood incident we were reluctant to go there but we didn’t really have a choice. Still, its pretty respectable that people work there regardless of weather.

After leaving Tsui Wah we thought it might be a good idea to use my umbrella! I opened it and the winds destroyed the poor thing in 5 seconds. Ah well.

Unfortunately we didn’t have time to buy many souvenirs because of the typhoon.
