Well we’re in Hong Kong, but I’ll update our escapades later. Nothing really interesting is happening anyway. I guess my 4 way trip to get a passport we forgot counts. We’re currently on the way to Macau by ferry which is an interesting experience, not least of which Steph suffers from severe sea sickness.

Ferry is a pretty cool experience, there are customs checkpoints and feels like a crappy airport.

Well anyway the journey should be about a hour, and I’ll try and update when I get there.
