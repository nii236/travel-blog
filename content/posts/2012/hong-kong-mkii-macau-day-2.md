Second day in Macau. Also the last. Today was spent more sight seeing stuff such as going to temples and stuff instead of going to the casinos (though we did go to the MGM grand casino at the end).

Took a taxi to A-Ma temple. Walked around for awhile and the temple was pretty unimpressive to be honest. REALLY smokey. There were hundreds of joss sticks everywhere, to increase power maybe. We soon left the firepit and moved on to the next stop in our self tour, which was the barracks on Barra st. Big building, steep walls. Then moved on to a cool church which we didnâ€™t end up entering because we did not abide by the dress code. We then went to Senado square, which is the centre of the city I suppose. Lots of shops and stuff.

While we were at Senado square we drank some nice Hojicha at Starbucks which is a funky earl tea jelly drink thing.

Lunch was much more interesting. It is my general mission to eat the weirdest thing I can find on the menu, which is a pretty damn dangerous mission when you are in China. So yes. I had turtles. Soft shelled turtles. Gelatinous skin with weird teeth and bones and claw bones inside. Shiver inducing indeed. But at least I can say I ate turtle! Slimy slimy goodness. Steph ate the decidedly standard crab congee.

After lunch we grabbed our luggage and heading off to MGM grand casino. Cool butterfly exhibition there. It was free too! Its basically just butterflies blahing about in an enclosure and you can enter and get them to land on you, all pretty and stuff. The place was nicely devoid of caterpillars somehow.

Headed back through customs and onto the near vomit-inducing ferry back to Hong Kong.
