Vienna! Europe! The land of sophistication and culture. Or something. It is a pleasant change from the harsh restrictions and controlled environment of Dubai anyway.

Also a nice change was to see couples of all ages… Making out. Seriously. I could only see so many hijabs before wanting to see a breath of fresh air that is seeing public displays of affection as soon as a I stepped off the air plane.

First place we went to was the Museum Quarter. Had a look at the cool architecture. Got scammed for the first time here too! Lady gives you a flower and asks for money afterwards. This is when you’re off guard because she comes out of nowhere. Won’t take the flower back. Clever lady. We gave her four euro to go away. She wanted five. I was never good at bargaining. We actually ran into the SAME lady a few days later in another area of the city. I told her politely to go away after she offered me a flower once again. We need to practice our assertiveness.

There is a fast food chain here called Nordsee. They focus in fried fish and stuff. We had some, it was pretty horrible to be honest.

Big ice cream culture here! Really tasty and cheap by Gelare standards. But that’s not really saying much, it’s not hard to be cheaper than a place that charges like 5.40aud for the scoops of ice cream or something. Pistachio and mohn flavoured ice cream. Never worked out what mohn was. Its like a poppy seed… Thing. Tastes okay though.

Naschmarkt was the next stop. This is a big market of some sort. Wasn’t very impressive. Mostly Turkish people selling ALL the same stuff. Seriously there were probably 20 shops selling stuff there that were very obviously supplied by the same poor cook.

Had my first schnitzel there too! It was pretty awesome, gigantic schnitzel. This would be one of many schnitzels to come. Also had a beer that no human could possibly finish. Yet I did after a lot of psyching myself up. It was like a litre of beer! I haven’t had a beer drinking training in my uni days after all.
