This was the last day in Vienna. Quite a decent stay here. I certainly enjoyed it more than Dubai. Too much walking though. A lot of people here have scooters. Motorized scooters!!! I am going to get one when I get back to Perth (in about 1000 years) and I am getting one and NO ONE CAN STOP ME.

Ahem.


# Day 4, Wien.

Cool icecream place! In the morning we went to Tichy. They have these weird icecreams that sort of look like a hybrid of fried icecream and standard scoops of the good stuff. Big icecream industry going on here in Europe.

Didn’t go with Steph though, she didn’t want to go. I went on my own! So much walking, it was in between two train stations so no easy way to get there. What stupid planning! *glares at Ballajura*. Anyway it was pretty decent. I really enjoyed it. Botball competition, physics games, lots of inventor history regarding physics, electricity generation,mining and robotics are all here. For some reason there is a section on hunting knives.
