Ahh Hungary, the favourite part of my trip so far. Budapest anyway. Saying I enjoyed Hungary is like saying I enjoyed my time in Yandhi, Western Australia. But not as hot.


# Day 1, Boo-Da-Pesht

So we took the bus to Budapest. It was three hours long and relatively uneventful. There was an awesome rest stop at a restaurant/petrol station hybrid called Marche. We had almost no time to actually eat there though so I will never know the wonderful cuisine that is Petrol Station foods in Europe. Seriously. The stuff in there looked better than most restaurants in Perth.

We’re too much into guzzling dat fossil fuel.The toilet break there was quite pleasant. We didn’t have the exact change for the toilet entry (I KNOW right? Paying to use the toilet? But in this case its okay because they are actually not the slummed up druggie central that is Perth petrol station toilets. They are actually on par with department store toilets, with automatic sliding doors INSIDE the bathroom area.). The cleaner lady came out, took all our small change and let us through. Very nice of her, but its probably just because she gets to keep the entire change as a tip as opposed to waiting for her violent communist oppressors to hand her currency whenever they feel like it.

So we land in the international bus terminal in Budapest. We ALMOST left our luggage behind. Good thinking on Steph to suddenly shout out our mistake. That would’ve been embarrassing. Plus painful to get out of the country without passports. Who knows, maybe it could’ve turned into an exciting round the world homeless backpacking trip that lasted 6 months or something.


![Mmm rundown bus terminal](/travel-blog/images/2013/05/img_20130428_154549.jpg)Mmm rundown bus terminalSo anyway the trains here are awesomely crappy. They screech and heave and ho to their stop. Everything is run down and needs maintenance. Its not BAD technology, just really OLD. Very functional… and Soviet. Many archaic buildings with wonderful architecture remains empty and desolate. Ruin pubs are very popular here, pubs that take place in derelict abandoned areas.

The entire city is basically under construction.So our train screeches to a stop and we have to find our way to the hostel. First of all, there are NO ESCALATORS. Good grief lifting a total of 40kg of luggages up and down stairs is… not easy.

And we ended up on the wrong side of the road. The whole city is currently under construction (due to some subway work) so all the crosswalks are not available. We chanced it and crossed the busy road. Survived! Barely.

Walked into the hostel and its a thing of beauty. It looks like a palace/church hybrid. Completely silent lobby which echoes. Paint stripping off the walls. We get taken to our private hostel ‘room’ and we were pleasantly surprised. The damn thing is like a 3 bedroom apartment. It was more furnished than the apartment I stayed in back home! Washing machine, dishwasher, about 4 beds, tv, sofa, couches, dining table, kitchen. DAMN! And all this for roughly 45EUR per night. So 22.5EUR per person. Amazing eh?

Lifts that have the old school gates. Rusty buildings, trains with screeching brakes, noisy buzzers. Surprised I didn’t see vacuum tubes or something for clocks.

But still I found it so very interesting and look forward to the next few days.
