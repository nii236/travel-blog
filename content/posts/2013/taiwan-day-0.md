We began the long long trek to Taiwan today. I’m typing this while I’m in the LCCT airport in Kuala Lumpur. The service is horrible! Even at the airport, the first person you see is super rude.

Of course you probably want to know stuff that is surprising, not standard fare for holidays.

Derp, I wrote a whole bunch of stuff but the WordPress app still sucks and I lost my work as soon as the Internet connection was a little shaky. The app should save offline drafts automatically and periodically. Noobs.

Anyway I can’t be bothered rewriting everything, just try and imagine what was written here for now while I summon the courage to write stuff again.
