Hello! This is the first time I have attempted blogging from my phone. Its quite difficult but nothing I can’t handle with my mighty technological thumbs.

Anyway we are in Dubai! This is the city built on evil oil money. Oil that we keep demanding so I guess it’s partially our fault too.

So Dubai has the biggest everything. Biggest mall, biggest indoor ski resort, biggest water park, biggest artificial islands. We took it upon ourselves to visit as many of those as we can.

In the first day we went to the mall of the Emirates. Huge mall! Ate frozen yoghurt, walked around the hypermarket (supermarket but more hyper), had some KFC (had cravings for awhile now)  then ate some nice dinner at Al Halabi, a Lebanese restaurant.
