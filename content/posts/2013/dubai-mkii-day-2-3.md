Behold! A COMBINED post! Mostly because I’m burning out writing so much and thinking so far back into the past, and also because Dubai this time around just wasn’t that interesting. We were busy relaxing and recuperating I think.

So read on and see what exciting shenanigans one can get up to in Dubai!


# Dubai MKII Day 2

So yeah this part of the trip was mostly just winding down. I bought a bunch of high value goods. Laptop, watch, games etc. There is a computer plaza here which to be honest, is pretty crap. Lots of old refurbished stuff and fake Chinese devices. After purchasing all my gear I discovered a superior shop across the road that is comparable to JB Hifi or something. New products, decent prices! Alas I am doomed to Buyer’s Remorse. The laptop I bought is decent at least. It can actually multitask without spitting the dummy unlike my current netbook back at site.

# Dubai MKII Day 3

We had a look at the Dubai Mall today. One of the biggest malls in the world I think? I can certainly confirm that. There is an entire Souk area which is just selling gold, diamonds and precious gems. I wasn’t really in the market for billion dollar gold ingots or something so we didn’t stay in that area for long.


![This is the souk, a subset of the mall guarded by fearsome camels. It was pretty empty here and we thought it was a waste of time coming to the mall. As luck would have it the rest of the mall was packed. Probably because people can't afford tonnes of gold during a tourist visit.](/images/2013/05/img-20130504-wa0000.jpg)This is the souk, a subset of the mall guarded by fearsome camels.

We didn’t go inside because it didn’t really look like much value for money going into that tunnel. The panel on the outside absolutely amazing though.


![Really sweet aquarium! Sharks and stuff too. I was waiting for some sort of survival of the fittest thing to start but none of the fish ate the others.](/images/2013/05/img-20130504-wa0002.jpg)Really sweet aquarium! Sharks and stuff too.

I guess this is just a giant candy shop but its got awesome interior design like most shops in Dubai. Hard to explain the place really. Some pics:


![Awesome ice cream here! Overpriced though. Actually I think we were just spoilt with the prices from Eastern Europe.](/images/2013/05/img-20130504-wa0001.jpg)Awesome ice cream here! Overpriced though. Actually I think we were just spoilt with the prices from Eastern Europe.

Like I can just jump off a waterfall to my doom without a care in the world.That pretty much concluded the entire holiday I think! We headed off to the airport after a rest in the hotel.

I’m not sure if I mentioned it before but DAMN the taxi drivers here drive so fast! I know I complained about it a few years back in my Hong Kong post but now I realise I was just being a wuss. The speed limit here is 100km/h which is normal enough. But they often drive as fast as they can. Seriously. Regular speeds of 130km/h here folks. Interestingly the speedometer has an inbuilt alarm at 120km/h. Its an alarm that means “WARNING! You’re about to take off!” I think. I can only assume the taxi drivers are wannabe pilots because they all leave the alarm beeping and zoom around 130km/h anyway.

We get the business class flight this time! Woot! Steph and I stayed in the business lounge for awhile, had some snacks, had a nap on horrible uncomfortable beds. Steph had to fly out about 5 hours before me so we said our goodbyes. She loved the business class flight! Rightfully so too, it’s a different league to cattle class. Too bad I won’t be able to enjoy business class much longer after this job in Ghana…
