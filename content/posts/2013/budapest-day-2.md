We asked the hostel owners if there is room service here. The guy was kind of shocked for some reason! Gave me a funny look. We were probably the first people to ask. Funny that, the reason I was asking was because we DIDNT want room service. Also when asking for a hair dryer and what the deposit for it was (10EUR back in Vienna) the guy also gave me a funny look and said “Uhh no deposit… just make sure you return it”. Nice to see some good trust going on here. In my defence the hair dryer was super old anyway and not worth stealing. Not that I was going to steal it if it was a new swanky one…

…Maybe.


# DAY 2 BUDAPEST

My personal chef Steph made this lovely… uhh.. aglio oglio salmon caviar olive oil spaghetti pasta thingomabobu.Time to explore the city! Time was pretty tight as you will find out in the coming days as I finish writing these overdue blog posts.

Plus no one bothers walking up and down the escalators because you'll be zooming around anyway.](/travel-blog/images/2013/05/img_20130429_211447.jpg)The escalators here move at a BLINDING speed.

Plus no one bothers walking up and down the escalators because you’ll be zooming around anyway.So for some reason there is a place called TRAP which is the 2nd highest tourist attraction in Budapest. Its one of the many escape rooms that are popular in this city. These are locked room puzzles where you have to solve multiple puzzles and find objects inside a room in order to get to a bomb to defuse it. The owner of the place watches you through CCTV and assists when you yell for help.

![Some promo pics of TRAP.](/travel-blog/images/2013/05/img-20130501-wa0004.jpg)Some promo pics of TRAP.I see this concept is quite confusing (unless you are a huge Nintendo DS gaming geek) and my lovely assistant Steph has summarised the steps required to pass the FIRST room. There are two rooms.

1. Pull out floppy disc from computer
2. Read writing on the floppy disc
3. Look up the word in a directory for a grid reference
4. Check grid reference on earth atlas globe thing
5. Use coordinates listed there to open a combination lock
6. Found a toy grenade in the desk drawer which contained a key to the wardrobe
7. Found a device inside a coat pocket in the wardrobe to remove a key currently attached to the wardrobe
8. Used key to open the first lock on the exit door
9. Turn wardrobe clothes rod to open a slot in the wall
10. Turn off lights with button in the slot
11. Combine the new shadows with old shadows to work out the letters using a code taped to the bottom of the desk drawer
12. The code were Roman numerals for the second stage lock on the exit door
13. Door was a deadend, and had a switch to release a marble into a marble maze
14. The marble maze is in darkness, and a team mate has to constantly ride a bicycle to keep the light on in the maze so the other person can solve the marble maze (dynamo!)
15. Received a screwdriver looking thing (this is actually a 6.35mm headphone jack)
16. Follow a maze on the wall until you find a hole in the wall
17. Insert headphone jack which shined the words “EXIT” on the wardrobe and unlocked the false back in the wardrobe which set us free!
18. Enter next room.

It was actually awesome fun! Definitely recommend anyone visiting Budapest to give it a go. You know, if you’re into the trapped-in-a-room-with-a-voyeuristic-serial-killer tourist type.

The second room was not as difficult but we did stupid mistakes. There was a pingpong ball that we were panicking with working out what to do with it. Steph put it into the vacuum cleaner tube and it took ages to fish out. Turns out the ping pong ball was transparent and there was clearly a piece of paper in side. Another time was when there was a key stuck in a maze and we were trying to use the vacuum cleaner to suck it out! Turns out you just grab a magnet from the shelf and use that to get the key out. We were panicking and not thinking clearly because time was running out. Funny how that affects one’s thinking process. The owner had to save us multiple times throughout the whole thing.

There were many red herrings. Such as a giant crank and winch and metal gears that look like they go somewhere.

We also made a mess. Pull out all the paint cans in the cupboard. Starting to remove all of the coats in the wardrobe before the owner had to yell out “no no leave the coats alone!”. Quite a friendly kidnapper!

We managed to defuse the bomb with 3 minutes remaining. Had to ask for a lot of help though, apparently its much easier when we have more people in the team. We were pretty bad at the game though. Missing obvious clues or looking in the wrong place or doing stupid things with objects. Surprised we managed to get through at all. Wish we did more of those though.

![WE'RE ALIVE!](/travel-blog/images/2013/04/img-20130507-wa0003.jpg)WE’RE ALIVE!For some reason we decided to grab some takeaway Hummus for breakfast. Probably from the excellent stuff we got from Dubai.

Grocery shopping was SO cheap in Budapest. I think about 5 times cheaper than Perth prices? That’s not saying much I guess but still. That’s for the drinks and stuff anyway, but meat and spices were also ridiculously cheap. I bought some cool local sparkling water (pear and cactus flavour wtf) for a cool 0.30AUD. Caviar was 2AUD, some of the meats cost about 3AUD. That and the fact hiring a hostel was cheaper than staying in the apartment back in East Perth makes a compelling argument for moving here.


![Mmm 2AUD caviar. Tasted like actual food too which is a bonus.](/travel-blog/images/2013/05/img_20130429_083020.jpg)Mmm 2AUD caviar. Tasted like actual food too which is a bonus.Rosenstein is one of the best rated restaurants in Budapest. It was… not very good. Really scary waitress lady. Gruff, rude, whacking down plates and far too curt. Its like she was really pissed off at us for existing. Steph might say something along the lines of me breaking every social convention there was when it comes to fine dining but I reckon there’s NO excuse for bad service. Well unless I was REALLY out of line, but I certainly don’t fit the bill for terrible customer. Weird, yes, but not terrible.
