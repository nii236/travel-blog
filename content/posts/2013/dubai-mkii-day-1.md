Sadly, its time to leave the somewhat sunny springtime scenery of Europe and to return to the desolate desert depths of Dubai. Its a reculture shock!


# DUBAI MKII DAY 1.


## The Return

How bad could it be?

Grabbed some airport food before the flight. KFC actually. Man I’m gonna miss that unhealthy fried chicken =(

Also looks a lot more scary but I know that’s just psychological. Birds get sucked into propellers or jet engines at roughly the same rate.This entire day was spent flying. Bah! Not much to say to be honest. We tried a different hotel this time around just for variety. Its called Golden Sands. Imagine our surprise when Golden Sands have TEN branches! And the Hostelworld booking doesn’t tell you! We ended up at Golden Sands 10. We ended up getting shipped off to Golden Sands 5.

A funny thing about this country is the fact that the taxi drivers don’t have GPSes. None. So often the taxi driver will get lost (happened plenty of times trying to get back to Golden Sands 5, the black sheep and ignored brother of the Golden Sands family no doubt). The taxi driver will be driving in circles, building up that damn meter and perhaps calling his brother in law or something to find out where the hotel is. A few times we just told him to stop there and walk and find the place ourselves. Ended up being faster. What a horrible system! Apparently one of the big issues is the fact that the city is very new. Roads are being built at all of the time. Its like living in a dreamworld, where things pop up the next day or something. Maybe. Or at least that’s how I like to think of it.
