I’m on a roll! Typing at the speed of light! Fingers tapping at the speed of sound! Tendons screeching at the speed of very fast tendons!


# Day 3. Vienna.

Today was mostly souvenir shopping. So expensive. The Austrians (are they Austrians or Viennese? Arnold Schwarzenegger or Waltz?) love to pimp Mozart. His face is plastered everywhere! Key rings, mugs, doors, posters, shop names, shop mascots, you name it. As annoying as that is, at least it makes it really easy to find music paraphernalia. Music themed stores are not popular in Australia. Something something football something.

Haus Der Musik. Also known as the House of Music. Some cool stuff here. One floor of DVD concert performances of the Viennese Philharmonik Blah. Second floor all about ear science. Beats, frequencies, vibrations, inner ears, etc. This was a REALLY creepy floor. Mostly dark and filled with creepy sounds. Third floor was audio tour of each of the famous musicians from Vienna. Strauss, Mozard, Beethoven, Mahler and some others. Pretty boring and interesting at the same time. Mostly learning about their lives and such. We accelerated the process near the end and left. Bought some music souvenirs. Actually I don’t remember if I did. Steph got a music scarf or something.

We also had a schnitzel for lunch. It was great.

Dinner was at Mariahilfer Brau. Pub food! I loved it. Tastes like home.
