Well after pleasant sleep in the dump we were in, we switched on the TV and happened upon a programme teaching Cantonese the intracacies of the English language. Crazy stuff on TV. Entertaining though.

Steph’s mind was working again this morning too. She was a bit speechless and quiet yesterday because of the shock from seeing the place we were staying in. I think she’s been well stocked and supplied for her entire life with decent living standards and neighborhoods. Well I will have to opt for a sink or swim methodology.

For breakfast we decided to aim for chance and walk around until we found something decent. As luck would have it we did! The food was cheap, plentiful and much tastier to eat than it was to look around. Steph ate the macaroni, abalone and ham soup and I ordered the buns with condensed milk. As luck would have it, Steph’s meal actually came with even more food, an extra buttered bun and two eggs! Her meal ended up being about 3.50 AUD and mine was 1AUD. We had coffee and tea as well but apparently it was pretty bad according to my travel partner. I didn’t notice any foul taste.

Attempting a random shopping spree is difficult if you have no idea where to go. Not to mention it was Sunday. We wanted a map of some sort to work out where the hell we were meant to go. We ended up invading the Holiday Inn, with its very nice trees, lights and actual floor. No map there. We found shoestring traveller and then a dodgy chinese dude ushered us in. He thought we were applying for a VISA to go to China. But after we entered we took a map and ran off. Armed with a map we were… still completely useless. We couldn’t find any decent landmarks so we ended up going to the train station to take a random ride somewhere. We picked the Ocean Park, a big theme park on another island.

Not much to say about the park. Cool rides, food, LOTS and LOTS of walking. Pics follow.

After the Ocean Park visit, we returned home and took a nap. Exhausted and feet were aching. I’m typing this after the nap. We’re gonna head off and find some places to eat dinner.
