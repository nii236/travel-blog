Well I’ve used this HTC desire hd for two days now and I’ve been really impressed! Got rid of the swype/slideit keyboard though because it was a lot slower because you have to move your finger so much! I can almost touchy the landscape keyboard here without too many issues. About 20wpm though :/. I’ve also just finished downloading a new software keyboard for my phone! It’s called SwiftKey and it’s pretty awesome so far
