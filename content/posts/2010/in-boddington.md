I’ve been playing around with the phone for a bit more and I think its great! Only problem is the lack of good offline maps and phone reception in Boddington. I can’t setup my international roaming or data packs in preparation for the trip :(. I’ll have to try and do it over the phone tomorrow while I’m at work…  or maybe it’s time to just bite the bullet and agree to bring the laptop!
