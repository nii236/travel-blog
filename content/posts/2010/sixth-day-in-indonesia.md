We visited the grave of Steph’s grandfather today. It involved informal prayer, followed by the burning of paper money, followed by another prayer. It was relatively short (about 1 hour) and it was in the morning.Shopping (yet again). Bought neat things though. Steph got some nice sport  shoes, a top and a dress. I bought an awesome bag, a linux penguin bathroom mat, and a ‘dirty’ jacket (no idea what else to call it). Hmm my money supply is running out…
