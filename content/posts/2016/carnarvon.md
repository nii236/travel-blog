So we continued on our extremely long journey to Exmouth.

Today we went to Carnarvon. I say 'went', but it was more of a long, arduous, challenging trek.

Yet here we are!

# HELLO CIVILISATION!

We stopped by the Billabong Roadhouse halfway. Steph drove the first half (good jerb!) and I drove the second half.

We finally got to Carnarvon and ate a chocolate covered banana, and sapote icecream at Morel's. I have no idea what the sapote is. I suspect its Sapodilla/Sapoche.

We wanted to go to Bumbak's for the same stuff but they close at 4pm!

We eventually got to our accomodation, at the Coral Coast Tourist Park. Its a caravan park but we are staying at one of the dongas.

Our new home.

There was a guy here equipped with the most amazing caravan I've ever seen!

*Autobots, roll out!*

We're about to head off to dinner. Surely there's some food around here right?

Tomorrow we will be heading to Exmouth!

UPDATE: Nope, we never made it to dinner. We decided to eat this instead.

*Much tasty*
