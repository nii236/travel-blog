It was quite an \u00a0interesting way of doing things. These guys have a very solid base. The theory seems to focus on stability and structurally sound methods of receiving force rather than using momentum to bat at an object. So what you\u2019d have is a kick, but the difference with the Aunkai style kick is that when it hits something, the momentum of the kicker\u2019s leg is not greatly affected.<\/div><div><\/div><div>Good fun in all, but each class will cost 2000 yen! 2000!

How thoughtful!<\/div><div><\/div><\/div><div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2008\/12\/dscf0083.jpg\"><\/a>\n<div>It hasn&#8217;t been that eventful for the past few days. Went to Ueno park and Ginza. We also went to an izakaya (Japanese bar), but we were told to go away. I&#8217;m assuming that they did not want foreigners but I&#8217;m really not sure. Interesting experience. Regardless, I managed to go to an izakaya the next night. More on that later.<\/div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There are some pics of our visit to the zoo in this entry. It was quite fun, except the giant panda &#8220;Ling Ling&#8221; passed away in April. The panda was one of Ueno zoo&#8217;s biggest attractions, so its unfortunate we didn&#8217;t get to see it.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I also had my first night of training with the guys at the Aunkai. I didn&#8217;t get to do much really, I only managed to do some exercises before my legs were in too much pain. Lots of squatting around and stuff. It was quite an \u00a0interesting way of doing things. These guys have a very solid base. The theory seems to focus on stability and structurally sound methods of receiving force rather than using momentum to bat at an object. So what you&#8217;d have is a kick, but the difference with the Aunkai style kick is that when it hits something, the momentum of the kicker&#8217;s leg is not greatly affected.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Good fun in all, but each class will cost 2000 yen! 2000! That&#8217;s 40 AUD per class! I felt sick inside when I heard Akuzawa say that -_-. I&#8217;ll try and do it anyway, its a big part of what I came \u00a0for anyway.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2008\/12\/dscf0022.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2008\/12\/dscf0083.jpg?w=300\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>This was quite a deceiving meal. At first it looked just like a pork bun. Steamy floury white bun. But imagine my surprise when I ordered it and the lady took it and plonked it in some soup. Then filled up the cup to the brim with soup. To my surprise the steam bun did not actually have any meat in it, nor was it a steam bun. It was just a block of tofu!\u00a0<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2008\/12\/dscf00231.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2008\/12\/dscf00231.jpg?w=300\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>Here are the three of us in the elevator.

Here is a double level carpark. Pneumatics or something push the car up after you park it. The only problem is if there is a car underneath you you&#8217;ll have to wait for it to leave first.\u00a0\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There was an even more awesome carpark I saw as well. It was like&#8230; a ferris wheel I suppose. Or a multi disc changer. You park your car into a slot and grab your ticket. Your car will be whisked away. When you need your car back you put the ticket in and the machine will bring your car to you!<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2008\/12\/dscf0025.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2008\/12\/dscf0025.jpg?w=300\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>More engrish!

There was some epic mud slide somewhere about 4 years ago which screwed up all the traffic and made the traffic slow to a crawl. It was more a 3 hour series of constant stopping, starting, jerking, emergency breaking and honking of the car horn. Felt very sick. Lucky I didn\u2019t hurl though, that probably would\u2019ve made a bad impression too! Valiant and Steph made the observation that these people live in so much chaos they are much better drivers than the ones in Perth. I\u2019d have to disagree though, if these people came to Perth, they\u2019d be fined and confiscated their license (if they even have one) for poor driving.

Two or three maids to take care of a lot of the menial tasks that we do back at home such as cleaning and laundry. They\u2019re on call pretty much 24\/7. Sit in a room with a TV while waiting for duties to pop up.

Poor confidence and stuff. Fixed it later though.<\/div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">Took an awful 3 hour drive down south to Malang. There was some epic mud slide somewhere about 4 years ago which screwed up all the traffic and made the traffic slow to a crawl. It was more a 3 hour series of constant stopping, starting, jerking, emergency breaking and honking of the car horn. Felt very sick. Lucky I didn\u2019t hurl though, that probably would\u2019ve made a bad impression too! Valiant and Steph made the observation that these people live in so much chaos they are much better drivers than the ones in Perth. I\u2019d have to disagree though, if these people came to Perth, they\u2019d be fined and confiscated their license (if they even have one) for poor driving. Being a good driver is all about how well you adhere to the status quo and rules of the current country.<\/div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">I got to see a lot of the way<span>&nbsp; <\/span>the country runs during that drive. It\u2019s pure chaos really. Huge divide between the rich and the poor. Lots of people begging as the cars roll past. Dodgy people recommending we take a \u2018secret\u2019 road to be able to get out of the enormous traffic jam.<\/div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally made it to the house. Very impressive house. Awesome walk in shower design. It\u2019s about twice as long as a normal shower. Two or three maids to take care of a lot of the menial tasks that we do back at home such as cleaning and laundry. They\u2019re on call pretty much 24\/7. Sit in a room with a TV while waiting for duties to pop up. It\u2019s a 24\/7 job, to which most \u2018fulltime\u2019 9 to 5 jobs pale in comparison. <\/div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">We went to the local mall. Very close and convenient! Only about 200m away. Didn\u2019t really do anything though because it was almost closing time. Just went to the arcade and played some games. DDR and Drummania.<\/div>\n<p><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 04:00:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 04:00:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 04:00:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":193,"title":"Second day in Indonesia","slug":"second-day-in-indonesia","markdown":"\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">Woke up at 930am.

Ended up walking around for awhile and then playing some pool with Steph and Deo. Steph was much much better at pool than I expected! Especially since she says she<span>\u00a0 <\/span>never plays and she hates the game. She almost beat me both times\u2026 -_-. After pool we played bowling.

It was a really high class place and the houses were gigantic! We were considering calling Steph\u2019s dad to come and pick us up, but I opted otherwise. We decided to walk all the way down the hill to find a road where a taxi can be found. After walking many shacks, houses with roosters pecking away in front, dodgy \u2018private taxi\u2019 fellows, bridges, trash landfills, a beautiful valley of trees (that was used as a trash landfill) among other things, we finally came upon a taxi!

Our goals today were to visit Hongkong island and find some good dim sum, visit the top rated bakery and find the street market over east in Causeway Bay.\n\nSkipped breakfast today to save stomach space for dim sum. We ended up eating anyway over at Central Hongkong. We found the dimsum place but it looked very high end, plus it opened at 2pm! We ate congee across the road. Very tasty. I had pork giblets in the congee and Steph had pork liver and kidney. I put truckloads of soy sauce in the congee and then the taste reminded me of home! Mmm. Pretty cheap too, works out to about 6AUD each.\n\nThe top rated bakery was meant to be next door but there heaps of protesters in the area for some reason. Didn\u2019t want to get in their way so we just headed off eastward to the markets in Causeway Bay.\n\nWe found plenty of bakeries along the way. In fact, we found plenty of everything. The problem I found with the bakeries was that most of their stuff is manufactured elsewhere and delivered later. This is because of the lack of space. Because of this, the Perth bakeries tend to be much fresher and tastier. We ran across some bakeries that had their own mini ovens and stuff in the back and those looked much better.\n\nAnyway when we entered Causeway Bay we came across many salons and hairdressing places. Steph needed to get her hair bonded\/straightened. It took about 4 hours total. I thought I might as well get my hair cut. This is the second time in my life since I\u2019ve been to a hairdresser. I didn\u2019t really know what to request so I just told him to cut it however he wanted. It ended up being some sort of horrific shark\/piranha cut.

Our goals today were to visit Hongkong island and find some good dim sum, visit the top rated bakery and find the street market over east in Causeway Bay.<\/p>\n<p>Skipped breakfast today to save stomach space for dim sum. We ended up eating anyway over at Central Hongkong. We found the dimsum place but it looked very high end, plus it opened at 2pm! We ate congee across the road. Very tasty. I had pork giblets in the congee and Steph had pork liver and kidney. I put truckloads of soy sauce in the congee and then the taste reminded me of home! Mmm. Pretty cheap too, works out to about 6AUD each.<\/p>\n<p>The top rated bakery was meant to be next door but there heaps of protesters in the area for some reason. Didn&#8217;t want to get in their way so we just headed off eastward to the markets in Causeway Bay.<\/p>\n<p>We found plenty of bakeries along the way. In fact, we found plenty of everything. The problem I found with the bakeries was that most of their stuff is manufactured elsewhere and delivered later. This is because of the lack of space. Because of this, the Perth bakeries tend to be much fresher and tastier. We ran across some bakeries that had their own mini ovens and stuff in the back and those looked much better.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway when we entered Causeway Bay we came across many salons and hairdressing places. Steph needed to get her hair bonded\/straightened. It took about 4 hours total. I thought I might as well get my hair cut. This is the second time in my life since I&#8217;ve been to a hairdresser. I didn&#8217;t really know what to request so I just told him to cut it however he wanted. It ended up being some sort of horrific shark\/piranha cut.

Will summarize.\n\nWoke up, ate breakfast. Steph ordered continental breakfast but was crappy, egg was cooked on the outside but inside the whites and yolk were completely raw. Wanted to complain but our Chinese consists of \u2018thankyou\u2019. I ate satay beef with instant noodles! Pretty good actually. Had scrambled eggs and butter bun too.\n\nWent to Causeway Bay again for Stephs rebonding of hair. Took about 2 hours. I went for a walk everywhere and stole internet to call Victor, Sami and home.\n\nAfter that we went to the Causeway Bay markets. Bought some jeans and fur tail things. Quite cheap, except the store owners are very anal about prices. We managed to haggle, with great effort, the fur tail thing from 99HKD down to 95HKD. That\u2019s about 50 cents.\n\nAfter that we ate rice pizza! Very nice, I\u2019d like to make it back at home.

Steph was not feeling well so I went for a walk for 2 hours around the area. Bought some shirts, sweaters and jeans from Bossini, a lovely cheap but mid range store. Came back to get Steph. We went and ate Vietnamese food for dinner! The staff spoke no Vietnamese. Food was actually pretty good. I ate Pho but there was no Hoai Xinh sauce!

I guess I\u2019m not cut out to be a writer\/blogger.\n\nKFC! We ate rice mushroom and flava crava. Some sort of batterless chicken, which ruins the purpose of KFC, also known as Krunchy FRIED Chicken. At least there was rice. No chips are available in HK KFC, instead they have some sort of monstrous fried basketweave.\n\nThe most interesting, yet horrifying thing about KFC in HK is the disgusting environment the toilets were in. I was about to puke, which is quite a statement considering my strong stomach. This is not including Steph, who is a germaphobe in the first place, and had to back out of the stairs initially, before dashing up. Actually even dashing up is difficult because the stairs were covered in slippery grime and mould. The smell was hideous and putrid. I get shivers just thinking about it. After our toilet break, Steph had to rewash everything outside the bathroom. Strange that, the KFC toilets are so disgusting they actually provide another sink outside it. Theres a single pic in the link.\n\nThis happened in Mong Kok by the way. It is a shopping district (like the rest of Hong Kong) tailored towards women. I, however, found great joy in the stationary shop like a woman. We spent many an hour in the many levels of the\u00a0stationary shop and spent more money than we have spent elsewhere yet. Over 1000HKD.\n\nInterestingly, shops in Hong Kong (in Mong Kok anyway) were not open until about 11am. This is a little silly for a city that never sleeps. They just sleep late. Many shops open late and close late. Not quite as great as extended trading hours, but it\u2019ll do.\n\nWe went to G2000 and got lots of nice things. G2000 is a store which sells extremely high end stuff for mid range prices. So I\u2019d get a pair of jeans for about 50AUD but in Australia they\u2019d cost over 150AUD. Steph got some work clothes and I got some jeans as mentioned. We spent quite a lot. So much, in fact, that the staff started clapping as we were leaving the store for some reason. I guess they were either very happy, impressed, or pitying us for spending so much. The \u00a0cashier fellow even gave a Neo-esque \u201cwoah\u201d when we brought all our stuff to the counter. But it wasn\u2019t that much to be honest, only about 6 items of clothing. My shopping spree in Melbourne was like 15 items.\n\nSteph fell ill this day. Still sick today. Cold symptoms which have gotten worse over the day. May have to go and see the doctor when we touch down in Singapore. Its pointless doing it here, because we have issues with the language. Hell, I was trying to buy salt in three different languages (Vietnamese, English, Japanese) to no success.\n\nSwing Dancing in evening. I (with great guilt) left Steph behind to fend for herself against the dangers of Hong Kong. I got kinda lost on the way. I had to trek about 30 minutes uphill in rainy weather in the Hong Kong CBD. Went into super high class foreigner diplomat establishment. Dirty wet backpacker hanging out with tailored suited businessmen. But it was the wrong place, then I found it next door after a lot of talking. Met lots of people there, was fun. Lots of Hong Kong born Americans, and ABCs. LBCs too (London). They were impressed with my dancing. Dancing is a good way to meet people overseas!\n\n6th Day\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nSteph is super sick today. I got her breakfast and lunch to eat in bed. We went out for dinner though, had a lovely dinner in the form of suckling pig and roast goose. Goose is SO much better than duck, because it is duck with more meat. Steph doesn\u2019t like it much because the meat is tougher. This was my first time trying suckling \u00a0pig and was very impressed. I would like to eat it back in Perth in the future.\n\nWent back to Causeway Bay today to find Wanko, a clothing store which is named very cleverly! \u00a0We were there to find clothing for Steph\u2019s mother. Not very successful though, the selection was very poor and limited. We were direct far away to the New Territories of Hong Kong. We may attempt to go there tomorrow if we are feeling adventurous.\n\nWent to Starbucks. I had toffee nut coffee and it was damn good. Steph had Hibiscus Blend Tea, which was also quite nice from what I hear. Schoolgirls were there too, not sure why because they\u2019re meant to be AT SCHOOL! But that is okay. Hong Kong school uniforms are similar to Japanese one\u2019s for some reason.\n\nWe went to a ski shop and bought stuff in advance for skiing! I bought some neat goggles and gloves, Steph bought glove, mask thing and earmuffs. We are hopefully prepared for the devastating winter of Japan. Today in HongKong was much colder than normal for some reason. Just for today. But its not unbearable (for me anyway) at about 9 degrees celsius.\n\nCame back to hostel as Steph was feeling really sick. I went to walk around Tsim Sha Tsui. I bought a new watch! Its a Tissot and it cost about 650AUD. It is a entry level swiss watch, and I think it looks great. Amazingly, the box is way cooler than the watch itself.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Pics!\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/aku.shinta\/Day5And6HongKong?authkey=Gv1sRgCPXr-Y2UmZ_UmAE#\">http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/aku.shinta\/Day5And6HongKong?authkey=Gv1sRgCPXr-Y2UmZ_UmAE#<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Late update, which is usually what happens when I type too much in too short a time.

I tried using my Kindle\u2019s free 3g internet (!) to hook into my laptop to update the blog but no go. Need more time at home to get it working. Anyway:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\n**Hong Kong**\n\nChecked out of the hostel. It was a relief to leave that place. The staff lady was so rude as well. We had to walk around\u00a0 for the whole day because our flight was in the afternoon. Wanted to get some nice shoes for Steph but she was approaching vomit\/fainting levels of illness. Ate crab congee which was great.\n\nWent to airport. Steph was at death\u2019s door from illness so there were issues running through the gargantuan airport. Had to walk slowly and take breaths otherwise her lungs would seize up. We got there eventually though, luckily we\n\n**Singapore**\n\nOne day in Singapore. I took the opportunity to explore the city that pretty much everyone has visited or stopped by. Quite nice. Lots of department stores for high end brands. Very westernised though, and the Singaporeans really like their Japanese themed stuff. I met a new friend too, some kid who has the same phone as myself. We were probably one of the few people in the city who had the phone since its so new. He wanted to know where I got my phone\u2019s case but he was disappointed when I told him it was from Hong Kong, not Singapore.\n\nDodgy stuff be happening in Singapore. People stare a lot more at others too. We ordered a meal in the morning for breakfast. We decided to change our order but the waitress decided to give us both of our orders! She didn\u2019t cancel the first one! No doubt an evil money grubbing scheme. Not to mention the restaurant also required that you pay for your food when it arrives, and before you eat. Very annoying.\n\n**KL**\n\nStopover.\n\n**Japan**\n\nStayed one night in Tokyo. The place was called Khaosan and it was quite nice. Since we arrived late and we ran into delays because we used pencil instead of pens for writing in our customs forms, we missed the final train into the city. Had to take a taxi for 10000 yen. Shared the cab with an American backpacker girl though so we managed to split the bill 3 ways. We were going to the same area too. She was quite interesting, lived in China for many months and then has been backpacking for a few weeks for the first time in India, Japan, Hong Kong and other countries. I\u2019d like to do that sort of thing someday, before I get any dependents and stuff.\n\n**HAKONE**\n\nStayed at a minshuku in Hakone called Shunkoso. Since we arrived in the afternoon instead of in the morning like we previously planned. This caused us big disappointment later in the evening. The Japanese railway system is so huge and complex that it took us way too long to just get from Asakusa stn. to Tokyo stn. in order to retrieve our JR Pass. We left Shunkoso at around 2:30pm to go to Mt. Owakudani \u2013 famous for it\u2019s black eggs, steaming smelly yellow sulphur thingies and onsen. We walked back to Hakone-Yumoto stn to catch the train there. The walk itself was interesting. The Hakone area has lots of ryokan (Japanese style inns), and shops selling local delicacies. After buying some souvenir, the store clerk offered us some preserved dried fruit. It was tamarind. Was so sour and salty, we couldn\u2019t even hide our expressions. I also made the mistake of sampling a coleslaw-looking thing\u2026 turned out to be fresh horseradish\/ wasabi. Cleared my nose.\n\nThe trip to Owakudani was agonisingly slow. One must take a 45min train to Gora, transfer to a 20min cable-car to Sounzan, before finally taking a rope-way\/ gondola to Owakudani. When you get there, one must of course climb the mountain. The last 2 would have been nice\u2026. if we didn\u2019t miss it -___-\u201c Upon arrival at Sounzan at 4:05pm, we discovered too late that the last rope-way ran at 4:15pm. We paid around 2000 yen to get to where we were already. I was pissed of course. We had to board the cable-car back down again, with all the other people returning from Owakudani. I can\u2019t believe something that touristy closes so early! It was totally dark by 4:30 pm. Annoyingly strange.\n\nI\u2019m glad that Shunkoso Inn is really awesome in comparison. The room was very spacious: with tatami mats, wooden furniture, closets, in-suite bathroom, and tv. It is weird that there were only 5 guests staying in the Inn. Johnny\u2019s last name was written on the board outside the Inn, along with 4 others, that\u2019s how I know. I pretty much had the public onsen to myself as well. There was only 1 old lady. I didn\u2019t feel threatened :p The onsen\/ bathing pledace is HUGE. There was the tatami-mat changing room, toilet, washbasin, mirror etc, then the shower and indoor onsen, then the outdoor onsen. The indoor onsen was too hot for my liking, so I went to the outdoor one. It was really nice and relaxing. Definitely the highlight of my day.\n\nDinner was simple instant noodles (was damn good though!), self-made and eaten inside the room whilst watching anime on the TV. By then, the tables have all been magically put aside, and the futon was set on the floor. Johnny couldn\u2019t sleep because it\u2019s his turn to be sick, so I had to coin scrape him. Although I used a small beer glass instead. He looks like a freaky skeleton fish now.\n\nThe next morning, we were woken up by a staff. \u201cOHAYOU GOZAIMAAAASU. SHOSHOKU WO TABETE KUDASAAAIII.\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 or something (\u2018Good morning, please eat breakfast\u2019). We head up to the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> floor for breakfast. It was impressive. Huge room once again, with 2 buffets \u2013 one traditional Japanese, the other Western continental. Of course i chose Japanese, and piled up everything there was onto my plates.

I tried using my Kindle&#8217;s free 3g internet (!) to hook into my laptop to update the blog but no go. Need more time at home to get it working. Anyway:<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hong Kong<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Checked out of the hostel. It was a relief to leave that place. The staff lady was so rude as well. We had to walk around\u00a0 for the whole day because our flight was in the afternoon. Wanted to get some nice shoes for Steph but she was approaching vomit\/fainting levels of illness. Ate crab congee which was great.<\/p>\n<p>Went to airport. Steph was at death\u2019s door from illness so there were issues running through the gargantuan airport. Had to walk slowly and take breaths otherwise her lungs would seize up. We got there eventually though, luckily we<\/p>\n<p><strong>Singapore<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One day in Singapore. I took the opportunity to explore the city that pretty much everyone has visited or stopped by. Quite nice. Lots of department stores for high end brands. Very westernised though, and the Singaporeans really like their Japanese themed stuff. I met a new friend too, some kid who has the same phone as myself. We were probably one of the few people in the city who had the phone since its so new. He wanted to know where I got my phone\u2019s case but he was disappointed when I told him it was from Hong Kong, not Singapore.<\/p>\n<p>Dodgy stuff be happening in Singapore. People stare a lot more at others too. We ordered a meal in the morning for breakfast. We decided to change our order but the waitress decided to give us both of our orders! She didn&#8217;t cancel the first one! No doubt an evil money grubbing scheme. Not to mention the restaurant also required that you pay for your food when it arrives, and before you eat. Very annoying.<\/p>\n<p><strong>KL<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stopover.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Japan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stayed one night in Tokyo. The place was called Khaosan and it was quite nice. Since we arrived late and we ran into delays because we used pencil instead of pens for writing in our customs forms, we missed the final train into the city. Had to take a taxi for 10000 yen. Shared the cab with an American backpacker girl though so we managed to split the bill 3 ways. We were going to the same area too. She was quite interesting, lived in China for many months and then has been backpacking for a few weeks for the first time in India, Japan, Hong Kong and other countries. I\u2019d like to do that sort of thing someday, before I get any dependents and stuff.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HAKONE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stayed at a minshuku in Hakone called Shunkoso. Since we arrived in the afternoon instead of in the morning like we previously planned. This caused us big disappointment later in the evening. The Japanese railway system is so huge and complex that it took us way too long to just get from Asakusa stn. to Tokyo stn. in order to retrieve our JR Pass. We left Shunkoso at around 2:30pm to go to Mt. Owakudani \u2013 famous for it\u2019s black eggs, steaming smelly yellow sulphur thingies and onsen. We walked back to Hakone-Yumoto stn to catch the train there. The walk itself was interesting. The Hakone area has lots of ryokan (Japanese style inns), and shops selling local delicacies. After buying some souvenir, the store clerk offered us some preserved dried fruit. It was tamarind. Was so sour and salty, we couldn\u2019t even hide our expressions. I also made the mistake of sampling a coleslaw-looking thing&#8230; turned out to be fresh horseradish\/ wasabi. Cleared my nose.<\/p>\n<p>The trip to Owakudani was agonisingly slow. One must take a 45min train to Gora, transfer to a 20min cable-car to Sounzan, before finally taking a rope-way\/ gondola to Owakudani. When you get there, one must of course climb the mountain. The last 2 would have been nice&#8230;. if we didn\u2019t miss it -___-\u201c Upon arrival at Sounzan at 4:05pm, we discovered too late that the last rope-way ran at 4:15pm. We paid around 2000 yen to get to where we were already. I was pissed of course. We had to board the cable-car back down again, with all the other people returning from Owakudani. I can\u2019t believe something that touristy closes so early! It was totally dark by 4:30 pm. Annoyingly strange.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m glad that Shunkoso Inn is really awesome in comparison. The room was very spacious: with tatami mats, wooden furniture, closets, in-suite bathroom, and tv. It is weird that there were only 5 guests staying in the Inn. Johnny\u2019s last name was written on the board outside the Inn, along with 4 others, that\u2019s how I know. I pretty much had the public onsen to myself as well. There was only 1 old lady. I didn\u2019t feel threatened :p The onsen\/ bathing pledace is HUGE. There was the tatami-mat changing room, toilet, washbasin, mirror etc, then the shower and indoor onsen, then the outdoor onsen. The indoor onsen was too hot for my liking, so I went to the outdoor one. It was really nice and relaxing. Definitely the highlight of my day.<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was simple instant noodles (was damn good though!), self-made and eaten inside the room whilst watching anime on the TV. By then, the tables have all been magically put aside, and the futon was set on the floor. Johnny couldn\u2019t sleep because it\u2019s his turn to be sick, so I had to coin scrape him. Although I used a small beer glass instead. He looks like a freaky skeleton fish now.<\/p>\n<p>The next morning, we were woken up by a staff. \u201cOHAYOU GOZAIMAAAASU. SHOSHOKU WO TABETE KUDASAAAIII.\u201d\u00a0 &#8211; or something (\u2018Good morning, please eat breakfast\u2019). We head up to the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> floor for breakfast. It was impressive. Huge room once again, with 2 buffets \u2013 one traditional Japanese, the other Western continental. Of course i chose Japanese, and piled up everything there was onto my plates. We open-roasted the mackerel fish on table, and\u00a0 I tried eating natto with my rice. That stuff is so messy. Why do they have to ferment beans? It\u2019s sticky and stinks like dead rat.

I\u2019m just writing this as a way of closure I suppose.\n\n**Kyoto**\n\nHere for two days. Went to various temples and Eigamura, a themed area showing the historical buildings of Japan. It shows how period films in meiji\/edo era were made. Pretty neat.\n\nTried cycling for a bit but Steph wasn\u2019t experienced enough in cycling to go through the hostile landscape. Ended up meeting her after cycling around town as she took the bus. She got a bit lost and stressed out though. Ended up okay.\n\n**Osaka**\n\nWent cycling. Very cold. Snowing. I thought it was ash at first but it was snow! Little flecks just flying through the cold, cold air. Face was freezing because I didn\u2019t have anything to cover it. I had to stop every now and then to stick my mouth and nose inside my jacket and to breath in my expelled air just to keep me warm\u2026 For some mysterious reason, I also got sick the next day! The illness plagued me for the rest of the journey.\n\nI was cycling without Steph because she was feeling sick. Stumbling around the hotel and puking and stuff. I felt bad leaving her there, but I pretty much did everything I could already.\n\nEnded up exploring the city. Not too much to look at to be honest. But I was in the scrums after all (no I don\u2019t know what that means). I ended up riding all the way up and visiting Osaka\u2019s Lindy Hoppers\/Swing Dancers for a friendly night of dancing! It was nice to be able to interact with the locals.\n\n**Hakuba**\n\nSnowboarding! Not much to say really. Great fun. Painful. Cold. Lots of snow. I got stuck underneath powder for awhile. Tried snowboarding over but it was about 1m of loose powder! Had to dig myself out and that took about 5 to 10 minutes. Quite scary up there too because of zero visibility and snow storms etc.\n\nSteph had a go on the ski boards. After a lot of initial frustration and vents (as usual) she eventually got the hang of it. We went up the ski lifts and I gave her a nice push down. She didn\u2019t know how to stop though so she kept accelerating all the way down! I couldn\u2019t keep up with her. Luckily she didn\u2019t slam into anybody though. But she really needs to get that hockey stop thing working.\n\nWe ate at a nice bar too. Canadatei. Lots of rowdy Australians (!) there. Next evening we ate at a pizza place. Very small servings so we were left hungry.\n\n**Tokyo**\n\nThe main city. Some pretty interesting stuff happened here.\n\nWent to Shinjuku, Akihabara and Shibuya. Not too much point really, going to all these shopping places (+Hong Kong) when Steph doesn\u2019t like shopping in the first place.\n\nWent to Disneyland. Lots of walking. Lots of waiting in line (2 or 3 hour waits) since the fast passes were not available for some mysterious reason. It was pretty cold too. After the Ocean Park Theme Park in Hong Kong, most of the thrill rides in Disneyland were pretty tame to be honest. I was just sitting there bored. But its all a matter of perspective. In Hong Kong I was clinging on for dear life and terrified for my safety. In a good way.\n\nWent to Harajuku, Akihabara and Asakusa. Great food stores in Harajuku. We didn\u2019t see the famed cosplayers hanging around the bridge though. Not sure. It was raining a bit. Bought various souvenirs today too. Ultra high tech nail clippers (!), headphones, food etc.\n\n**Malaysia**\n\nStayed for one night. Pretty interesting country. At least they have cheap accomodation! We stayed in a 5 star hotel!\n\nThe Malays are much ruder than I expected. Eye rolling, unsmiling arrogant attitudes etc. The Indian and Chinese-Malaysians were pretty cool though.\n\nMet up with Russell. Helped us around the hostile environment so that was really appreciated. Ate at a really dodgy but authentic Malaysian food court. Tasty food too! Lots of foreigners, much more than I expected.\n\nWent to Kinokuniya. Its a Japanese bookstore! I finally found my Picross puzzle books. I looked all over Japan for them and yet here they are in Malaysia instead -_-.\n\nCool shops everywhere.

We found the place recommended to us by a friend called Nhu Lan. Tasty, but the bread isn\u2019t airy enough! Lots of pate though, good stuff.\n\nThe taxi driver then took us to a place to change money. The staff seemed pretty slack. They didn\u2019t even bother looking at the current exchange rates, just swapped 21 000 vietnamese dongs for a dollar.\n\nWent to Vincom plaza to play some vibraphone. We also bought a funky dog toilet paper dispenser. Very expensive compared to the rest of our trip, ended up being 1 million dongs or something since I bought a duck money bank with the dog (I\u2019m a sucker for ducks, edible or non edible).\n\nThe dog dispenser was quite a complicated adventure actually. I had my suspicions on whether or not the dog \u00a0worked. I believed the paper would rip at the wrong point because the funnel for the tissue was too tight. We ended up running over to the nearby supermarket and buying a roll of toilet paper and testing it on the dog. Yes, I know, we are very classy high class tourists. The roll didn\u2019t end up working unless you took out enough paper so there we were in the most expensive plaza in Saigon unrolling the toilet paper and throwing toilet paper everywhere. We bought the dog.\n\nWe had to rush home and pack our bags. We were very late. The dude that picked us up was a completely random dodgy dude, in a kidnappers van. It was a 9 seater or something, which shouldn\u2019t be in a cramped city like Saigon in the first place. The windows were fully tinted. I didn\u2019t trust the fellow (I don\u2019t think anyone could, except his mum maybe), so I had to choose my wording carefully to make sure I don\u2019t give away critical information. Plus the fact that he grabbed our luggage immediately didn\u2019t help. The conversation went like this:\n\nMe: So\u2026 what company are you from\/Who sent you?\n\nHim: (Some random name who could\u2019ve been the tour guide or driver from yesterday)\n\nMe: So\u2026 What time were you meant to be here?\n\nHim: I was here since 11am\n\nMe: *Getting suspicious since he was meant to be here at 1pm* So\u2026 do you know where we\u2019re meant to be going?\n\nHim: (Some random Vietnamese I didn\u2019t understand)\n\nMe: *Wondering why the hell I asked a question whose answer I would not understand anyway* So\u2026\n\nHim: *Shows me an SMS saying to pick up 2 people at 1pm*\n\nMe: Herp Derp good enough\n\nLuckily we were not kidnapped, but were driven pleasantly to the airport. TWENTY MINUTES LATE! We checked in, dashed to the security checkpoint where they started doing the final call. We ran into a douchecanoey security guard who was giving everyone a hard time about crossing lines on the floor and generally being an ass. I suppose he needed more control in his life, maybe his wife gives him a hard time or something. I was, however, pleased that he booted people who were trying to push in (due to lateness) to the back of the line, or at least wherever people would let them in.\n\nWe dashed all the way to gate 12. Ran into the bus, sweaty, huffing and puffing. Then the bus just sat there for another 10 minutes, so we were really rushing for no reason!\n\nWe then took the flight to Da Lat, the lovely Paris of Asia. For some mysterious reason I have acquired the ability to collapse into a coma as soon as I sit in a plane seat. I honestly sit down and then arrive at my destination. I don\u2019t even remember the safety inductions! Steph, however, is there twiddling her thumbs since she has a giant slab of a human snoring next to her.\n\nWe arrived in Da Lat one hour later with stomachs about to implode from hunger. Met with the tour guide, a friendly Vietnamese man known as Mr Hoang. His English was barely understandable unfortunately. His vocabulary is pretty good but his pronounciation leaves much to be desired. With much concentration we can understand him though.\n\nWe were allowed to eat at the local pho place near the airport. It tasted damn good (probably because we were so hungry). Surprisingly enough, we\u2019ve eaten at so many dodgy street side places yet we do not have the runs! Well, I had mini runs for an hour or so but luckily nothing as drastic as Sidoarjo mudslide in my stomach when I was in Indonesia.\n\nChecked in the hotel. They stole our passports. We panicked for awhile but all is well.\n\nWent for a massage because I\u2019m very secure in my manliness. Steph is not secure in her manliness but that\u2019s okay. The massage was really no good, but that\u2019s because we just came from Saigon Golden Lotus Spa and Massage Club. That place was exquisite. This place, however, had loud blaring music that mutes randomly, and maximises the volume randomly. The CD also skipped tracks, seeked randomly and got stuck. It was not as relaxing as I would\u2019ve hoped.\n\nThe music itself in this ENTIRE town, seems to consist solely of my Dad\u2019s music collection. Not sure how this happened, but there must\u2019ve been some sort of time warp. I will need to investigate with my TARDIS.\n\nAnyway, after the massage, Steph had her womanly pedicure and manicure. I did not have one because I am not secure enough in my manliness. Steph has not had one before so she wanted to give it a go. Apparently it is one of the most painful things she has ever encountered. Not to mention unnecessary. She states she will not do it (willingly) ever again. Anaesthetic, bleeding fingers, cutty pokey women and still hurting a day later! Not sure why all those Aussies subject themselves to the Vietnamese nail salons back home.\n\nFor dinner we went to a fancy foreigner cafe named V Cafe. I ordered roast pork, hoping for roast pork. However this seems be illogical according to the kitchen there and I was treated to some tough rubbery steamed pork with a bit of mash potato sitting meekly next to it. Steph had crispy noodles stir fry. Attempting to get Pho Xao, but that stuff is rare as ambrosia. Almost.\n\nLive music was being played at the cafe, but two old vietnamese dudes, coincidentally also playing tracks from my Dad\u2019s music collection. It was incredibly loud, and the guitar vocals man was drowning out the harmonica man on purpose. Plus they kept changing keys constantly. Maybe to keep interest? I have no idea. I am however, impressed by their accent while singing.\n\n\n","html":"<p>We had a craving for Banh Mi Thit, possibly pronounced &#8220;Bang My Tit&#8221; in colloquial Australian English.

She likes the weather a lot more and the fact that we are living in an actual hotel with actual hygiene standards seems to impress her as well. As a dirty Vietnamese male, I have no problems living in a hovel, but I can also understand the delights of true hospitality. I do not think this hotel is worth four stars though, probably more like 3.\n\nToday was \u00a0quite productive. We had a tour. First stop was breakfast. Omelettes were amazingly hard to order. Steph wanted a single egg, sunny side up. How the hell does a vietnamoman say that in Vietnamese?\n\nMe: I WISH FOR THE SUN TO FACE UPWARDS MY GOOD MAN\n\nDude cooking eggs: WTF?!\n\nThere are always issues with direct translations between languages which I have discovered many many times on this trip.\n\nWe went elephant riding! Steph wanted to feed the elephant so we got a bunch of sugarcane. The sugarcane was cut up by our tour guide. This was a surprise, as he was wearing a nice dress shirt and pants and decided to pick up a machete and start chopping at the sugarcane. Now that I think about it, its not that surprising that a Vietnamese guy can pick up any knife and use it well. Its genetics!\n\nThe elephant was fed by us. It was quite cheeky, and kept grabbing and hoarding all the sugarcane into its mouth. This is because it knows that we have much more food in our hands and will be handing it over in due time. It only started chewing AFTER we hid the remaining sugarcane and stepped back. Greedy elephant.\n\nWent for a ride on the elephant for an hour. It was a very steep slope in the forest. The elephant had no issues walking around such rough terrain. Though it was slow as hell. The elephant also went ahead and took its toilet breaks during the trip.\n\nWent to a rivercruise of some sort. It basically involved a little boat with a two stroke engine slapped on the deck attached to a rotor. Extremely loud and annoying, but it was still cool with the scenery \u00a0and the fresh wind. The lake was known as \u00a0Thuyen Lam Lake. Due to the loud noises, it was about as romantic as sitting amongst rose petals with your beloved while getting punched in the face repeatedly.\n\nWent to this \u00a0waterfall thingy. I think it is called Prenn Waterfall. Not much to say here except we were toboganning. This was actually a blast! Its like a speed controllable rollercoaster.\n\nWe went to the theme park after that. It was known as the Valley of Love. Had funky coupley sculptures everywhere. Rode horses! That was pretty cool. Aussie horse riding usually has the owner holding the horses by the reins and you just sit there. At this place, however, you were allowed to steer the horses. Good fun. Steph was unimpressed though, since apparently in Indonesia horses were allowed to gallop around.\n\nVisited the local market and the tour guide helped us choose random tropical fruits. We bought a whole bunch of mysterious fruits which we will be trying later.\n\nDa Lat seems to love artichokes for some reason. Artichoke tea, soup, etc.\n\nHad frog legs and eels for dinner. Eels were too bony. Unimpressed by this dinner.\n\nThe hotel service really sucks, asked about where to go to do laundry but they wouldn\u2019t tell me, instead preferring to make us use the hotel service which costs a lot. Also when I asked where to go to dinner they just pointed at the one across the road. There is not enough information provided by this hotel.\n\nNo one is living at this hotel either. The bottom floor is completely empty and the lights in the hallway are always off. I think there is a few other people and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s actually a recurring theme here for some reason. Restaurants, bars and hotels are all almost empty. No one else at the massage thing at the hotel, the hotel bar is completely devoid of staff and residents, breakfast consisted of us and one other family. Creepy.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Steph is very glad to \u00a0be in Da Lat. She found Saigon to be a bit of a dirtheap (don&#8217;t blame her to be honest).

It basically involved a little boat with a two stroke engine slapped on the deck attached to a rotor. Extremely loud and annoying, but it was still cool with the scenery \u00a0and the fresh wind. The lake was known as \u00a0Thuyen Lam Lake. Due to the loud noises, it was about as romantic as sitting amongst rose petals with your beloved while getting punched in the face repeatedly.<\/p>\n<p>Went to this \u00a0waterfall thingy. I think it is called Prenn Waterfall. Not much to say here except we were toboganning. This was actually a blast! Its like a speed controllable rollercoaster.<\/p>\n<p>We went to the theme park after that. It was known as the Valley of Love. Had funky coupley sculptures everywhere. Rode horses! That was pretty cool. Aussie horse riding usually has the owner holding the horses by the reins and you just sit there. At this place, however, you were allowed to steer the horses. Good fun. Steph was unimpressed though, since apparently in Indonesia horses were allowed to gallop around.<\/p>\n<p>Visited the local market and the tour guide helped us choose random tropical fruits. We bought a whole bunch of mysterious fruits which we will be trying later.<\/p>\n<p>Da Lat seems to love artichokes for some reason. Artichoke tea, soup, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Had frog legs and eels for dinner. Eels were too bony. Unimpressed by this dinner.<\/p>\n<p>The hotel service really sucks, asked about where to go to do laundry but they wouldn&#8217;t tell me, instead preferring to make us use the hotel service which costs a lot. Also when I asked where to go to dinner they just pointed at the one across the road. There is not enough information provided by this hotel.<\/p>\n<p>No one is living at this hotel either. The bottom floor is completely empty and the lights in the hallway are always off. I think there is a few other people and that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s actually a recurring theme here for some reason. Restaurants, bars and hotels are all almost empty. No one else at the massage thing at the hotel, the hotel bar is completely devoid of staff and residents, breakfast consisted of us and one other family. Creepy.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 02 Dec 2011 16:04:57 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 02 Dec 2011 16:04:57 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 02 Dec 2011 16:04:57 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":703,"title":"Photos for the first week of vietnam","slug":"photos-for-the-first-week-of-vietnam","markdown":"\nBehold!

Didn\u2019t realise that we needed to go through the immigration process with arrival cards and the whole shebang.\n\nTook a taxi to the hotel. Came across some funky buildings on the way. This place is so different to Hong Kong. It\u2019s actually\u2026 Just like Vietnam! Crazy. Maybe it has something to do with the French and Dutch being here instead of the British so instead of being industrious and sipping tea they focus on weird architecture and\u2026 Parks. Parks with exercise machines. They really have to be seen to be believed.\n\nWe decided to go exploring the city on the poorer side. Not much to look at but we needed some food! Lunch I think. At 3 pm or something. The seasick inducing ferry wasn\u2019t very helpful for our stomachs.\n\nWe ended up making it to a Mcdonalds! Truly the cuisine of the locals. But we decided against it and went across the road to a place that intimidated us earlier since it was completely in Chinese. We had to order from pictures. I think the staff were so excited to see us that they gave us a discount at the end too! Tasty food but it was strange. Wonton soup is pretty normal but the dish I got was weird. It had some sort of chicken dish that didn\u2019t look like chicken at all. Tasty though, in a mysterious way.  \n Macau is well known for being the Vegas of Asia.

There is a damn moat cutting through the stores along the centre! There are also gondola rides you can take on the moat too. Pretty awesome. We were in a huge rush because it was already late and wanted to go to Ice World. This is a exhibition that the casino was holding, presumably a world made of ice. But we found out later. With the fear of ice in its name, we spent some time looking for some warm clothing for Steph, lest she freeze over upon entering the door of ICEWORLD!\n\n(Ridiculously tight and uncomfortable) Stockings and (emergency) turtleneck later, we pretty much ran all the way to Ice World. Paid our tickets and dashed in. To our surprise they actually gave you jackets to wear to avoid the cold. So all that rush before was pointless, or so we thought.\n\nWe donned our jackets and noted how damn hot it made us feel. But then they opened the door to ICEWORLD. It was DAMN cold. I suppose it makes sense that it would be below freezing but it was still a huge surprise. We just ran to station to station to keep ourselves as warm as possible and then exited the exhibition. Cool stuff there, ice labyrinth, ice piano (operational), ice slides etc. See below for pixeltastic details.\n\nAte at the Tsui Wah restaurant in the Venetian afterwards. Surprisingly enough it is a Chinese restaurant. They had the COOLEST bowls ever, which I wish to buy as souvenirs as soon as I can find the damn things. Ate a nice cheese bake thingo and other things. Pics for details. I even bought a fancy pants milk ice tea champagne. To my disappointment, it was just ice milk tea. In a ice bucket.\n\nWe went to the Galaxy Casino immediately after. Went into the Crystal Piano Bar. It took awhile to find it, we followed the doorman\u2019s directions, ended up going the wrong way and then walking a full circle all the way back to the doorman. We dashed away before he could see us to avoid embarrassment.\n\nCrystal piano bar very classy. A little too classy. Live music and nice girl singing jazzy tunes. Costly stuff. Theres a damn 10% service surcharge on almost all of the places in Hong Kong. Yes, even in the places with really bad service where all the ladies shout at you. Kind of ruins the idea of service charges.\n\nTaxied back home to our hotel. Cheap taxis. 5 buck maybe.\n\nHotel is not bad. Aircon sucks. I can basically smell the mould going into my lungs. Or maybe its Chinese air freshener.\n\n\n","html":"<p>ALERT: Due to severe crappiness of my Android app, images will be uploaded in a different method.

I suppose it makes sense that it would be  below freezing but it was still a huge surprise. We just ran to station to station to keep ourselves as warm as possible and then exited the exhibition. Cool stuff there, ice labyrinth, ice piano (operational), ice slides etc. See below for pixeltastic details.<\/p>\n<p>Ate at the Tsui Wah restaurant in the Venetian afterwards. Surprisingly enough it is a Chinese restaurant. They had the COOLEST bowls ever, which I wish to buy as souvenirs as soon as I can find the damn things. Ate a nice cheese bake thingo and other things. Pics for details. I even bought a fancy pants milk ice tea champagne. To my disappointment, it was just ice milk tea. In a ice bucket.<\/p>\n<p>We went to the Galaxy Casino immediately after. Went into the Crystal Piano Bar. It took awhile to find it, we followed the doorman&#8217;s directions, ended up going the wrong way and then walking a full circle all the way back to the doorman. We dashed away before he could see us to avoid embarrassment.<\/p>\n<p>Crystal piano bar very classy. A little too classy. Live music and nice girl singing jazzy tunes. Costly stuff. Theres a damn 10% service surcharge on almost all of the places in Hong Kong. Yes, even in the places with really bad service where all the ladies shout at you. Kind of ruins the idea of service charges.<\/p>\n<p>Taxied back home to our hotel. Cheap taxis. 5 buck maybe. <\/p>\n<p>Hotel is not bad. Aircon sucks. I can basically smell the mould going into my lungs. Or maybe its Chinese air freshener.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 16:03:41 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 16:03:41 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 16:03:41 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":809,"title":"Hong Kong MKII - Macau Day 2","slug":"hong-kong-mkii-macau-day-2","markdown":"\nSecond day in Macau.

Unsurprising, pretty much every single building and slum is a shopping and food hall in disguise (yes, even ChungKing mansion).\n\nWe ate a brunch first, and to do so headed to MongKok. This is a shopping district well known for bargaining, cheap clothing and shoes and stuff.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 500px;\">![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-camerazoom-20120719172818578.jpg \"CameraZOOM-20120719172818578.jpg\")<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">As well as other horrific things not suited for human eyes <\/figcaption><\/figure>Ate at Cafe de Coral. I\u2019ve been there about three times now and it has always been a very\u2026 Interesting experience. Stressful too. Strange systems and lots of people barking at you in Cantonese.\n\nBasically you order your food and pay and get a receipt. There is then an entire assembly line of food servers that you pass your tray down. So there is a rice lady, then a cutlery lady, then a mains food lady then a drinks lady. All of them constantly shouting in Cantonese. I have no idea when they\u2019ve given me my whole meal but apparently they push the tray back to you when that is the case. Also of note is that the assembly line is only relevant for standard food. For BBQ orders you have to enter the assembly line from the other side and go right to left instead of left to right. That way at the end of either the standard food line or the BBQ line you have the drinks dude in the middle giving out drinks to both lines. This all happens in a blinding split second. Or at least it felt that way.\n\nWhile the service is usually really rude in Hong Kong, at least its for a reason. Every second counts and every single that a slow dopey foreigner like myself or Steph wastes is a second lost of business. Its understandable, unlike the Malaysian bad service where the staff have nothing to do but when they need to do something they usually complain or roll their eyes at you. Its bizarre.\n\nHeaded to the Argyle Cetre after that upon a recommendation from a friend. Pretty cool place, lots of crazy shops and choices all crammed into a tiny area. We explored only two floor but I suspect there is more. Left Argyle and got some shoes just outside. Took awhile, the dude serving us was basically a runner and had to sprint between shops if that current shop didn\u2019t have the stock. Very impressive!\n\nHeading to Langham Place after that also upon recommendation from a friend. We have a large list of places to go in each district from a friend who grew up in Hong Kong you see. This helps a lot. Last time we were here it was mostly just being lost and flailing around. It helps to have a general itinerary.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 500px;\">![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-camerazoom-20120719154853784.jpg \"CameraZOOM-20120719154853784.jpg\")<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Feeling welcome at Langham Place <\/figcaption><\/figure>Anyway Langham Place is a big department store of sorts. Ate some Mos Burger. Which is a cool rice burger (I posted a pic of it somewhere on this blog). Had Pepper Lunch. Can buy this in Perth but its available here for slightly cheaper and I guess we just had the desire for some normal tasting steak. Grabbed some dessert from Honeymoon.

Unsurprising, pretty much every single building and slum is a shopping and food hall in disguise (yes, even ChungKing mansion).<\/p>\n<p>We ate a brunch first, and to do so headed to MongKok. This is a shopping district well known for bargaining, cheap clothing and shoes and stuff.<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 500px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"CameraZOOM-20120719172818578.jpg\" class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-camerazoom-20120719172818578.jpg\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">As well as other horrific things not suited for human eyes <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Ate at Cafe de Coral. I&#8217;ve been there about three times now and it has always been a very&#8230; Interesting experience. Stressful too. Strange systems and lots of people barking at you in Cantonese. <\/p>\n<p>Basically you order your food and pay and get a receipt. There is then an entire assembly line of food servers that you pass your tray down. So there is a rice lady, then a cutlery lady, then a mains food lady then a drinks lady. All of them constantly shouting in Cantonese. I have no idea when they&#8217;ve given me my whole meal but apparently they push the tray back to you when that is the case. Also of note is that the assembly line is only relevant for standard food. For BBQ orders you have to enter the assembly line from the other side and go right to left instead of left to right. That way at the end of either the standard food line or the BBQ line you have the drinks dude in the middle giving out drinks to both lines. This all happens in a blinding split second. Or at least it felt that way.<\/p>\n<p>While the service is usually really rude in Hong Kong, at least its for a reason. Every second counts and every single that a slow dopey foreigner like myself or Steph wastes is a second lost of business. Its understandable, unlike the Malaysian bad service where the staff have nothing to do but when they need to do something they usually complain or roll their eyes at you. Its bizarre.<\/p>\n<p>Headed to the Argyle Cetre after that upon a recommendation from a friend. Pretty cool place, lots of crazy shops and choices all crammed into a tiny area. We explored only two floor but I suspect there is more. Left Argyle and got some shoes just outside. Took awhile, the dude serving us was basically a runner and had to sprint between shops if that current shop didn&#8217;t have the stock. Very impressive!<\/p>\n<p>Heading to Langham Place after that also upon recommendation from a friend. We have a large list of places to go in each district from a friend who grew up in Hong Kong you see. This helps a lot. Last time we were here it was mostly just being lost and flailing around. It helps to have a general itinerary.<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 500px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"CameraZOOM-20120719154853784.jpg\" class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-camerazoom-20120719154853784.jpg\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Feeling welcome at Langham Place <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Anyway Langham Place is a big department store of sorts.

Headed over to the very Chinese unsounding Din Tai Fung restaurant in an attempt to find some dim summy type of food. Ended up being a standard restaurant with a really cool wonton thingo. Can\u2019t remember the name, Xiao Lao Bao or something? Wai Ai Kan Su Pik Chai Nees\u2026 =(\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 500px;\">![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-img_20120720_112641.jpg \"IMG_20120720_112641.jpg\")<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">They had like 20 people in a kitchen that can hold 3 people. 3 Australians anyway. <\/figcaption><\/figure>We came too early by the way. The restaurant opens at 1130am. Not to mention most shops open around 10am. Man my entire body clock is stuffed up now that I expect things to be open at weird times so I end up sleeping super late, and also waking up super late. Also since the city\u00a0 is always alive we tend to find ourselves walking around looking for dinner at 10pm or something. I\u2019m turning Chinese noooo!\n\nSo we kind of lurked and slunk around the restaurant for about 20 minutes. The staff lined up when it opened and since we were the first customers to walk in they all bowed and greeted us in Taiwanese (I think? Its a Taiwanese restaurant). Pretty cool!\n\nANYWAY the wonton thing is basically a wonton with soup INSIDE it. So you put it in your soup spoon, cover it with ginger and sauce of some sort. Then you POKE the damn thing with your chopsticks and suddenly your spoon is filled with soup!. Then you plonk it in your mouth. Tastes great. Its like magic soup wonton bombs. Or something.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 500px;\">![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-img_20120720_115714.jpg \"IMG_20120720_115714.jpg\")<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Behold!

I think it worked out to 20 bucks a head. A lot, but standard in Perth I guess. And this was far above and beyond what you can get in Perth. Unlike the dimsum we went to a few days later which I\u2019ll cover in the future.\n\nExplored the World Trade Centre afterwards. Which is also a department store in disguise. Surprise! Bought bits and bobs for the apartment back home. Lots of awesome cooking stuff there hey. Cool rice cookers and pots and pans and tools of all shapes and sizes.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 500px;\">![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-img_20120720_123405.jpg \"IMG_20120720_123405.jpg\")<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">So tasty, you can take photos with anthropomorphic wonton soup bombs! <\/figcaption><\/figure>Was about to go to the recommended hair cut place in the WTC (as recommended by the tour guide brochure this time anyway) and the damn thing would have costed me close to 50AUD! No way!

It was quite a nice surprise that I got a decent hair cut this time. Girl had good taste. The only instructions I gave her were to make my hair \u201cshort, but not too short\u201d.

Blowdrying and checking himself out. Maybe he was on a break or something but it was pretty unprofessional. And that\u2019s ignoring his green cockatoo haircut in the first place.\n\nWent back to Mongkok (I think) that evening.Wanted to head to the computer centre to buy some stuff and just look around. My plan was to buy the Nexus Tab but the people here aren\u2019t very up to date with technology weirdly enough. They have truckloads of imitation tablets though which are pretty decently specced, but run Android 2.1 blegh. Bought a nifty looking USB drive. 32GB. Steph also bought a flash drive, novelty in the shape of sunflower from Plants vs Zombies. An excellent theme in my opinion.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 500px;\">![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-img_20120720_220831.jpg \"IMG_20120720_220831.jpg\")<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nice and quiet here in Mong kok<\/figcaption><\/figure>Also go the damn keyboard so I can start blogging. Should\u2019ve just brought my trusty mechanical keyboard from Australia. They sell the Ducky Shine keyboard here! I was looking absolutely everywhere for it last year in Kuala Lumpur. Too bad I already spent way too much on keyboards already or I would\u2019ve bought that on the spot too. This keyboard I\u2019m using now is pretty decent though I guess.

Yep I'm in Asia <\/figcaption><\/figure>Bought some shoes from Hush Puppies, my well trusted brand. Well, the only one that has been reliably able to handle my gargantuan feet. Have I mentioned that I possibly have the biggest feet in the city? I spent the past few days going to 5 or so crocs stores to find some damn crocs in the size and style that I wanted. I\u2019m only a size 11 too! Finally managed to get some. They look hideous, but pretty cool at the same time. Don\u2019t hate me for wearing crocs!\n\nActually crocs are very big in Hong Kong.

They are very skilled at bargaining, but this was the one moment where I was allowed to commit my pent up stress and rage from living in Hong Kong and shout in English the price I wanted. It was quite satisfying actually. It went something like this:\n\n\u201cHow much are these sunglasses?\u201d  \n \u201c120HKD\u201d  \n \u201cOkay I\u2019ll give you 60HKD\u201d  \n \u201cNo way! 110HKD\u201d  \n \u201cOkay\u2026 65HKD\u201d  \n \u201cFinefine 100HKD\u201d *She starts putting the sunnies into a bag*  \n \u201cWTF ARE YOU DOING RAWR RAWR\u201d\n\nAnyway go the sunnies for 80 bucks. I never said I was good at bargaining. I still am bad. But at least I managed to shout at someone for once.\n\nSteph bought an iPhone cover here as well. Interestingly all the crap you can buy online (cheap clothes, electronics etc) are all here. This is where it comes from, all the crappy chinese electronics and clothing you see on eBay and stuff. Its not that much cheaper here I guess, but still a little better. Plus you can see how sucky it is before buying unlike buying off the internet with perfectly proportioned perfectly plastically surgeried girls posing in a superior tailored version of the same clothing.\n\nWent back to Langham Place, ate some lovely crab congee at Chee Kai amongst other things.

Man my entire body clock is stuffed up now that I expect things to be open at weird times so I end up sleeping super late, and also waking up super late. Also since the city\u00a0 is always alive we tend to find ourselves walking around looking for dinner at 10pm or something. I&#8217;m turning Chinese noooo!<\/p>\n<p>So we kind of lurked and slunk around the restaurant for about 20 minutes. The staff lined up when it opened and since we were the first customers to walk in they all bowed and greeted us in Taiwanese (I think? Its a Taiwanese restaurant). Pretty cool! <\/p>\n<p>ANYWAY the wonton thing is basically a wonton with soup INSIDE it. So you put it in your soup spoon, cover it with ginger and sauce of some sort. Then you POKE the damn thing with your chopsticks and suddenly your spoon is filled with soup!. Then you plonk it in your mouth. Tastes great. Its like magic soup wonton bombs.

My plan was to buy the Nexus Tab but the people here aren&#8217;t very up to date with technology weirdly enough.

It went something like this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;How much are these sunglasses?&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;120HKD&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;Okay I&#8217;ll give you 60HKD&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;No way! 110HKD&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;Okay&#8230; 65HKD&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;Finefine 100HKD&#8221; *She starts putting the sunnies into a bag*<br \/>\n&#8220;WTF ARE YOU DOING RAWR RAWR&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Anyway go the sunnies for 80 bucks.

Interestingly all the crap you can buy online (cheap clothes, electronics etc) are all here. This is where it comes from, all the crappy chinese electronics and clothing you see on eBay and stuff. Its not that much cheaper here I guess, but still a little better. Plus you can see how sucky it is before buying unlike buying off the internet with perfectly proportioned perfectly plastically surgeried girls posing in a superior tailored version of the same clothing.<\/p>\n<p>Went back to Langham Place, ate some lovely crab congee at Chee Kai amongst other things.

I, however, was guiltily chomping away happily at my condensed milk bun and brown chicken.<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 500px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"IMG_20120721_114106.jpg\" class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-img_20120721_114106.jpg\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brown chicken!

Chilled out in the LAN cafe for an hour waiting for our massage appointment to arrive (2pm I think it was). This was when I uploaded all my photos online to Google+. Pretty cheap ends up being 20HKD for an hour for two people. This works out to about half the price of LAN cafes in Perth. Not that anyone really goes to LAN Cafes anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Went to the (strangely Japanese centric) massage place. Costed quite a bit but I was too scared to go to the dodgy basement ones that were advertised everywhere in TST. I&#8217;ve heard horror stories of 100% surcharges or just price hikes and fine print, enforced by burly men (or at least men with pointy sticks). Maybe. So we decided to pay through the nose.<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 500px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"IMG_20120721_123214.jpg\" class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-img_20120721_123214.jpg\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">This was on the way upstairs to the massage place.

That damn lady probably had a big grin on her face as she poked, prodded, crushed, pinched and elbowed me everywhere. Meanwhile I gritted my teeth through the worst of it. And the best of it. Some nice moments during that massage, which were punctuated pleasantly by death grips and painful stabs.<\/p>\n<p>Foot massage after was pretty neat though. I have pretty big feet so I get more value for money than Steph!

Though it still makes me wonder, doesn&#8217;t everyone work? How the hell do these people afford to shop and eat out ALL THE DAMN TIME?!

This blog post will cover 23 July onwards. The holiday was meant to finish on the 24th of July but we eventually delayed until the 25th I think.\n\nAnyway the typhoon was going pretty crazy around now. The typhoon signals range from 1 to 10. Level 8 is pretty much danger level! Shops would close and people would be told to go home from work etc. I don\u2019t really blame them, winds and rain were battering everything everywhere at level 8! At this point of the we were still going at a very cool level 3.\n\n![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-hong-kong-mkii-23-07-2012-5-15-02-pm.jpg \"Hong Kong MKII 23-07-2012 5-15-02 PM.jpg\")\n\nWe decided to go to Mong Kok today. Returned to it because it was the most interesting place so far. We went to Langham place because the typhoon was too strong so we had to stay underground. So we woke up, bought an umbrella for emergencies at 7\/11 then ran across the road to the subway entrance. This was our only time outside for now, otherwise we would\u2019ve been killed by the flying debris.\n\n![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-hong-kong-mkii-23-07-2012-2-03-06-pm.jpg \"Hong Kong MKII 23-07-2012 2-03-06 PM.jpg\")\n\nMade it to Mongkok station, then used the underground connection to Langham Place. Gotta stay underground! Rain was everywhere! We ate some breakfast at Chee Kai. Crab congee again, it tasted really good! I think this is the second time we\u2019ve had the same dish here heheh.\n\nDecided this was our moment to use up all of our money so we took the lift to the top floor then slowly made our way down. This place is better than other department stores because they aren\u2019t overpriced brand names or 1000 dollar shoes but rather normal small shops selling stuff.\n\n![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-hong-kong-mkii-23-07-2012-2-28-24-pm.jpg \"Hong Kong MKII 23-07-2012 2-28-24 PM.jpg\")\n\nThe layout of the department store is pretty cool. The escalator takes you all the way to the top. You can\u2019t take escalators between floors (not easily anyway, I never worked out how to do it), but instead you just walk around the place in a spiral and you\u2019ll eventually go down floors.\n\nWhile there Steph bought a cool watch which the shop assistant insisted many times about the quality of the item because its hand made in JAPAN. Japan is synonymous with ultra high quality with most Asians for some reason. Steph is skeptical and thinks the leather strap for the watch is going to snap pretty soon. We shall see.\n\n![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-hong-kong-mkii-23-07-2012-1-03-36-pm.jpg \"Hong Kong MKII 23-07-2012 1-03-36 PM.jpg\")\n\n![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-hong-kong-mkii-23-07-2012-2-08-45-pm.jpg \"Hong Kong MKII 23-07-2012 2-08-45 PM.jpg\")\n\nWe also found a shop that sells cutesypoo stuff. Lots of earmuffs, cushions, blankets and bags all in a cutesypoo theme, such as fluffy animals or furry thingoes. Steph really liked this store, and went away from it with two earmuffs and a blanket with a penguin face as an integrated pillow as well as some penguin feet. I myself bought a cool turtle pencil case looking thing.\n\n![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-hong-kong-mkii-23-07-2012-6-59-00-pm.jpg \"Hong Kong MKII 23-07-2012 6-59-00 PM.jpg\")\n\n![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-hong-kong-mkii-23-07-2012-7-00-40-pm.jpg \"Hong Kong MKII 23-07-2012 7-00-40 PM.jpg\")\n\nI found a neat sack bag thing, which is ideal for bringing to the gym. A lot of people probably think it looks dinghy but I think it is cool and is anime styled like Naruto or something. Ninja looking sack bag. I\u2019ve used it a few times and am pretty happy with it, it holds all my gym gear as well as my super duper olympic lifting shoes.\n\n![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-hong-kong-mkii-23-07-2012-8-06-23-pm.jpg \"Hong Kong MKII 23-07-2012 8-06-23 PM.jpg\")\n\nIt was tricky at this point because we actually ran out of money! I miscalculated and didn\u2019t realise this until it was too late. I tried to pull out money from the ATMs but they weren\u2019t giving me any. This is why I hate relying on credit cards while travelling. After about three ATMs I finally tried another bank\u2019s ATM (Bank of China in this case) with success! There is probably a ginormous surcharge for using it though. Never good to withdraw using credit cards.\n\n![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/wpid-hong-kong-mkii-23-07-2012-7-50-49-pm.jpg \"Hong Kong MKII 23-07-2012 7-50-49 PM.jpg\")\n\nOnce we were done with Langham place we decided to head to the cool Argyle Centre again. This also required a quick dash across the typhoon rains. We made it in one piece though. Argyle Centre was cool but we never actually looked at the rest of the levels. I think there were about 3 or 4 floors in all. We tried to fix that this time around and was reasonably successful. Steph managed to get some decent clothing and bags amongst other stuff. The stuff here was geared towards women so I couldn\u2019t really buy much here. I regret not buying more stuff at the Mongkok Computer Centre though.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_999\" style=\"width: 300px;\">[![](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/hong-kong-mkii-24-07-2012-10-35-43-am_1296x972.jpg?w=300 \"Hong Kong MKII 24-07-2012 10-35-43 AM_1296x972\")](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/hong-kong-mkii-24-07-2012-10-35-43-am_1296x972.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hong Kong, where talent means having enough money to afford apple products<\/figcaption><\/figure>The typhoon blocked most of our attempts to go anywhere else so we just headed back home in TST for nap.

I was a little worried, but apparently Hong Kong people were just happy to be able to leave work early. I had to scout around in the rain for a place to eat since we were both pretty hungry and then found out that the Tsui Wah restaurant was open 24\/7, rain or shine\u2026 or typhoon! After the rotten seafood incident we were reluctant to go there but we didn\u2019t really have a choice.

Plus I used my credit card on my last few purchases in Hong Kong since we ran out of money completely. We were broke! We had 100AUD between us but that was all spent on the blasted airport entry\/exit tax. I think we managed to fish our some more AUD somewhere and get enough money for a really bad tasting sandwich. We also bought a drink but for some mysterious reason the Bali airport decided to set up a security checkpoint JUST OUTSIDE the flight gate! This means that after going through the first security checkpoint, we had all our water confiscated. So we bought some water in the departure lounge. Then before we could leave we got the water confiscated again! Not one to be outdone, we decided to drink the entire bottle of water in about 30 seconds before we went through the checkpoint. That checkpoint was so pointless and made our day even worse.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1004\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/hong-kong-mkii-25-07-2012-2-15-01-pm_1296x972.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1004\" title=\"Hong Kong MKII 25-07-2012 2-15-01 PM_1296x972\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/hong-kong-mkii-25-07-2012-2-15-01-pm_1296x972.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">First class for me!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1003\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/hong-kong-mkii-25-07-2012-2-14-41-pm_972x1296.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1003\" title=\"Hong Kong MKII 25-07-2012 2-14-41 PM_972x1296\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/hong-kong-mkii-25-07-2012-2-14-41-pm_972x1296.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Only croc owners get red carpet treatment<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As expected we were so very thirsty on the plane.

We\u2019re still in Dubai.\n\nWe realised that we didn\u2019t budget properly for our time in Dubai. So we have decided to eat like the less fortunate people\u2026 At the food court!\n\nAlso today is ski day. Yes, we decided to ski in a desert.\n\nWeirdly enough the city tends to open at 10am, as opposed to the 9am that I\u2019m used to. Or in the case of crazy Australia cafes, 6am.\n\nAnyway so we went skiing. The first step was to get a power pass which grants us access to the snow park as well as all the upgrades possible in the snow park and then you get one skiing lesson included.\n\nThe snow park was\u2026 Unimpressive. Tiny, understaffed, unfriendly and uninspired rides. Don\u2019t do it! Waste of money. The chair lift people didn\u2019t help us when needed so we missed a stop.\n\nThe skiing lesson was definitely better. We took the discovery lesson together. Was one hour of going up a travelator, skiing down while braking and attempting to turn. We had a lesson with a very obnoxious Indian guy from London. Between sessions of berating his wife he would be attempting to slow down on the skis but crash impressively into the wall. The wall was unfortunately padded. Anyway the skiing was great fun and redeemed the wasted cost of the power pass a little. I still prefer snow boarding but Steph likes skiing because it means less falling on your bum.\n\nAfter Al halabi yesterday we realised we were not wealthy enough to eat at those sorts of places regularly. So we went to the food court! Ate some sharwarma which sounds cool but is just shaved meat from a slab of meat. Also had some fried keppeh which is fried meat. Quite good. It looks like the infamous hom sui gok. An interesting point is that they always give free bread with everything whenever one eats out in Dubai. Truckloads of it too! Turkish bread is much thinner and easier to eat.\n\nLater in the day we decided to visit a mall called the Ibn Battuta. This mall is named after a great explorer who visited far lands. Because of this the mall is divided into six sections, one for each of his travels. China, India, Persia, Egypt, Tunisia and Andalusia. See photos below. The mall itself was kind of boring, same shops.\n\nOur target was to walk all the way to china and then had to go back to take the train. This felt like approximately 1km each way. It was probably much shorter but we are not good at walking. On the way back we asked the information desk if there was a bus that can take us back to the Egypt section. The guy looked at us in a funny way and said it\u2019s just a ten minute walk. Our legs were starting to fail so I insisted there must be a club car of some sort. The information guy said there was one but we had to pay for it. Being the stingey people we are we said no and limped away in defeat towards Egypt. He probably thought we were the most pathetic people in the world. In our defence we just finished a skiing season so our legs were busted in the first place.\n\nOnce we made it to Egypt we decided to eat japanese food. Obviously since we were in Dubai. Or not. Anyway the food was decent and we got our asian food while in Egypt.\n\nOnce we got back we basically fell into bed unconscious from the busy day. Probably around 9pm. With this sort of brutal treatment of our bodies we will soon become walking machines!\n\n[![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_110837.jpg \"IMG_20130422_110837.jpg\")](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_110837.jpg)\n\n[![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_111356.jpg \"IMG_20130422_111356.jpg\")](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_111356.jpg)\n\n[![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_131922.jpg \"IMG_20130422_131922.jpg\")](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_131922.jpg)\n\n[![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0005.jpg \"IMG-20130425-WA0005.jpg\")](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0005.jpg)\n\n[![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0003.jpg \"IMG-20130425-WA0003.jpg\")](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0003.jpg)\n\n[![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_134224.jpg \"IMG_20130422_134224.jpg\")](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_134224.jpg)\n\n[![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0010.jpg \"IMG-20130425-WA0010.jpg\")](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0010.jpg)\n\n[![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0006.jpg \"IMG-20130425-WA0006.jpg\")](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0006.jpg)\n\n[![image](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0013.jpg \"IMG-20130425-WA0013.jpg\")](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0013.jpg)\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Day two!

Tiny, understaffed, unfriendly and uninspired rides. Don&#8217;t do it! Waste of money. The chair lift people didn&#8217;t help us when needed so we missed a stop.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The skiing lesson was definitely better. We took the discovery lesson together. Was one hour of going up a travelator, skiing down while braking and attempting to turn. We had a lesson with a very obnoxious Indian guy from London. Between sessions of berating his wife he would be attempting to slow down on the skis but crash impressively into the wall. The wall was unfortunately padded. Anyway the skiing was great fun and redeemed the wasted cost of the power pass a little. I still prefer snow boarding but Steph likes skiing because it means less falling on your bum.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">After Al halabi yesterday we realised we were not wealthy enough to eat at those sorts of places regularly. So we went to the food court! Ate some sharwarma which sounds cool but is just shaved meat from a slab of meat. Also had some fried keppeh which is fried meat. Quite good. It looks like the infamous hom sui gok. An interesting point is that they always give free bread with everything whenever one eats out in Dubai. Truckloads of it too! Turkish bread is much thinner and easier to eat.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Later in the day we decided to visit a mall called the Ibn Battuta. This mall is named after a great explorer who visited far lands. Because of this the mall is divided into six sections, one for each of his travels. China, India, Persia, Egypt, Tunisia and Andalusia. See photos below. The mall itself was kind of boring, same shops.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Our target was to walk all the way to china and then had to go back to take the train. This felt like approximately 1km each way. It was probably much shorter but we are not good at walking. On the way back we asked the information desk if there was a bus that can take us back to the Egypt section. The guy looked at us in a funny way and said it&#8217;s just a ten minute walk. Our legs were starting to fail so I insisted there must be a club car of some sort. The information guy said there was one but we had to pay for it. Being the stingey people we are we said no and limped away in defeat towards Egypt. He probably thought we were the most pathetic people in the world. In our defence we just finished a skiing season so our legs were busted in the first place.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Once we made it to Egypt we decided to eat japanese food. Obviously since we were in Dubai. Or not. Anyway the food was decent and we got our asian food while in Egypt.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Once we got back we basically fell into bed unconscious from the busy day. Probably around 9pm. With this sort of brutal treatment of our bodies we will soon become walking machines!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_110837.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" title=\"IMG_20130422_110837.jpg\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_110837.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_111356.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" title=\"IMG_20130422_111356.jpg\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_111356.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_131922.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" title=\"IMG_20130422_131922.jpg\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_131922.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0005.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" title=\"IMG-20130425-WA0005.jpg\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0005.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0003.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" title=\"IMG-20130425-WA0003.jpg\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0003.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_134224.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" title=\"IMG_20130422_134224.jpg\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img_20130422_134224.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0010.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" title=\"IMG-20130425-WA0010.jpg\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0010.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0006.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" title=\"IMG-20130425-WA0006.jpg\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0006.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0013.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" title=\"IMG-20130425-WA0013.jpg\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/wpid-img-20130425-wa0013.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 19:16:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 19:16:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 19:16:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1037,"title":"Dubai Day 3","slug":"dubai-day-3","markdown":"\nWe\u2019re still in Dubai.\n\nToday we attempted to go to the Jumeirah palm, which is the world\u2019s largest artificial island.\n\nBut first we actually decided to go to the Dubai marina.

It was pretty awesome, gigantic schnitzel. This would be one of many schnitzels to come. Also had a beer that no human could possibly finish. Yet I did after a lot of psyching myself up.

There are two rooms.\n\n1. Pull out floppy disc from computer\n2. Read writing on the floppy disc\n3. Look up the word in a directory for a grid reference\n4. Check grid reference on earth atlas globe thing\n5. Use coordinates listed there to open a combination lock\n6. Found a toy grenade in the desk drawer which contained a key to the wardrobe\n7. Found a device inside a coat pocket in the wardrobe to remove a key currently attached to the wardrobe\n8. Used key to open the first lock on the exit door\n9. Turn wardrobe clothes rod to open a slot in the wall\n10. Turn off lights with button in the slot\n11. Combine the new shadows with old shadows to work out the letters using a code taped to the bottom of the desk drawer\n12. The code were Roman numerals for the second stage lock on the exit door\n13. Door was a deadend, and had a switch to release a marble into a marble maze\n14. The marble maze is in darkness, and a team mate has to constantly ride a bicycle to keep the light on in the maze so the other person can solve the marble maze (dynamo!)\n15. Received a screwdriver looking thing (this is actually a 6.35mm headphone jack)\n16. Follow a maze on the wall until you find a hole in the wall\n17. Insert headphone jack which shined the words \u201cEXIT\u201d on the wardrobe and unlocked the false back in the wardrobe which set us free!\n18. Enter next room.\n\nIt was actually awesome fun! Definitely recommend anyone visiting Budapest to give it a go. You know, if you\u2019re into the trapped-in-a-room-with-a-voyeuristic-serial-killer tourist type.\n\nThe second room was not as difficult but we did stupid mistakes. There was a pingpong ball that we were panicking with working out what to do with it. Steph put it into the vacuum cleaner tube and it took ages to fish out. Turns out the ping pong ball was transparent and there was clearly a piece of paper in side. Another time was when there was a key stuck in a maze and we were trying to use the vacuum cleaner to suck it out! Turns out you just grab a magnet from the shelf and use that to get the key out. We were panicking and not thinking clearly because time was running out. Funny how that affects one\u2019s thinking process. The owner had to save us multiple times throughout the whole thing.\n\nThere were many red herrings. Such as a giant crank and winch and metal gears that look like they go somewhere.\n\nWe also made a mess. Pull out all the paint cans in the cupboard. Starting to remove all of the coats in the wardrobe before the owner had to yell out \u201cno no leave the coats alone!\u201d. Quite a friendly kidnapper!\n\nWe managed to defuse the bomb with 3 minutes remaining. Had to ask for a lot of help though, apparently its much easier when we have more people in the team. We were pretty bad at the game though. Missing obvious clues or looking in the wrong place or doing stupid things with objects. Surprised we managed to get through at all. Wish we did more of those though.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1205\" style=\"width: 225px;\">[![TRAP! Also stands for Team Race Against Puzzles.

Probably from the excellent stuff we got from Dubai.\n\nGrocery shopping was SO cheap in Budapest. I think about 5 times cheaper than Perth prices? That\u2019s not saying much I guess but still. That\u2019s for the drinks and stuff anyway, but meat and spices were also ridiculously cheap. I bought some cool local sparkling water (pear and cactus flavour wtf) for a cool 0.30AUD.

Its one of the many escape rooms that are popular in this city. These are locked room puzzles where you have to solve multiple puzzles and find objects inside a room in order to get to a bomb to defuse it.

There are two rooms.<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n<li>Pull out floppy disc from computer<\/li>\n<li>Read writing on the floppy disc<\/li>\n<li>Look up the word in a directory for a grid reference<\/li>\n<li>Check grid reference on earth atlas globe thing<\/li>\n<li>Use coordinates listed there to open a combination lock<\/li>\n<li>Found a toy grenade in the desk drawer which contained a key to the wardrobe<\/li>\n<li>Found a device inside a coat pocket in the wardrobe to remove a key currently attached to the wardrobe<\/li>\n<li>Used key to open the first lock on the exit door<\/li>\n<li>Turn wardrobe clothes rod to open a slot in the wall<\/li>\n<li>Turn off lights with button in the slot<\/li>\n<li>Combine the new shadows with old shadows to work out the letters using a code taped to the bottom of the desk drawer<\/li>\n<li>The code were Roman numerals for the second stage lock on the exit door<\/li>\n<li>Door was a deadend, and had a switch to release a marble into a marble maze<\/li>\n<li>The marble maze is in darkness, and a team mate has to constantly ride a bicycle to keep the light on in the maze so the other person can solve the marble maze (dynamo!)<\/li>\n<li>Received a screwdriver looking thing (this is actually a 6.35mm headphone jack)<\/li>\n<li>Follow a maze on the wall until you find a hole in the wall<\/li>\n<li>Insert headphone jack which shined the words &#8220;EXIT&#8221; on the wardrobe and unlocked the false back in the wardrobe which set us free!<\/li>\n<li>Enter next room.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It was actually awesome fun! Definitely recommend anyone visiting Budapest to give it a go. You know, if you&#8217;re into the trapped-in-a-room-with-a-voyeuristic-serial-killer tourist type.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The second room was not as difficult but we did stupid mistakes. There was a pingpong ball that we were panicking with working out what to do with it. Steph put it into the vacuum cleaner tube and it took ages to fish out. Turns out the ping pong ball was transparent and there was clearly a piece of paper in side. Another time was when there was a key stuck in a maze and we were trying to use the vacuum cleaner to suck it out! Turns out you just grab a magnet from the shelf and use that to get the key out. We were panicking and not thinking clearly because time was running out. Funny how that affects one&#8217;s thinking process. The owner had to save us multiple times throughout the whole thing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">There were many red herrings. Such as a giant crank and winch and metal gears that look like they go somewhere.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We also made a mess. Pull out all the paint cans in the cupboard. Starting to remove all of the coats in the wardrobe before the owner had to yell out &#8220;no no leave the coats alone!&#8221;. Quite a friendly kidnapper!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We managed to defuse the bomb with 3 minutes remaining. Had to ask for a lot of help though, apparently its much easier when we have more people in the team. We were pretty bad at the game though. Missing obvious clues or looking in the wrong place or doing stupid things with objects. Surprised we managed to get through at all. Wish we did more of those though.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1205\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130429_125153.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1205\" alt=\"TRAP!

That&#8217;s not saying much I guess but still. That&#8217;s for the drinks and stuff anyway, but meat and spices were also ridiculously cheap. I bought some cool local sparkling water (pear and cactus flavour wtf) for a cool 0.30AUD. Caviar was 2AUD, some of the meats cost about 3AUD. That and the fact hiring a hostel was cheaper than staying in the apartment back in East Perth makes a compelling argument for moving here.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1202\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130429_083020.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1202\" alt=\"Mmm 2AUD caviar.

The city was small enough that we managed to pretty much see all of the touristy things within those 4.5 hours. Pretty decent.\n\nWe had some awesome ice cream during the tour. They scoop the icecream in a rose shape! Also grabbed some bean goulash from a local stall\/restaurant thing. Surprisingly also really good.

Steph saw the futility of it and starting walking roughly from the start. Still what a trooper! I\u2019m very impressed and pleased that she went on this tour, knowing full well the difficulty and duration that it involves. Who knows, maybe next time we can go on a 10 hour tour? That was actually my original plan for this trip. A SEVEN DAY bike tour going all the way from Austria to Budapest. That would\u2019ve been pretty amazing but considering our performance this time around we probably would never have made it to our destination if we did that tour.

I think Steph decided to lay down somewhere and rest on my lap. At this point the tour guide had a suspicion we were getting tired (HAH) and sped up through the rest of the tour.\n\nSo yes. We were kind of tumbling around rather than walkin since our legs were completely busted by the end of the day. So we slowly tumbled over to a decently looking pub restaurant thing. Due to the horrific experience the night before with Hungarian food I don\u2019t know what we were thinking with going to another Hungarian restaurant. Luckily everything turned out fine. Great service, great food. Its almost as if you can\u2019t judge a country by only a few of its citizens!\n\nThere is also the fact that yesterday at Rosenstein it was in a really dodgy area. Like, Ballajura pub dodgy or Koondoola dodgy. So maybe the waitress last night was so sick of fighting off druggies or something every night she has turned into a cynical and bitter lady.\n\nSo anyway we decided to order some good food to make up for our calorie munching journey (for you fitness geeks, yes I  \n know the calories burnt from cycling was insignificant and almost trivial, thankyou). Steph made a point that she always seems to eat more manly food than I do. I can vouch for this. I remember eating some sort of elegant gourmet plum duck pie once while she chomped away at a giant steak. I\u2019m not quite sure what to make of that.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1276\" style=\"width: 300px;\">[![Steph's energetic face after the tour.](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa0036.jpg?w=300)](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa0036.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Steph\u2019s energetic face after the tour.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1277\" style=\"width: 225px;\">[![My energetic face after the tour.](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa0037.jpg?w=225)](http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa0037.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">My energetic face after the tour.<\/figcaption><\/figure>What I CAN confirm is that yes, this time around she did indeed have a much more manly meal than me.

Did a (very very difficult) beginners lesson and then moved on to some social dancing. This is the only sample of nightlife I had while in Budapest (which is well known for its partying atmosphere) and I enjoyed it. This was on a much smaller scale than the typical partying that goes on in this city though, but then again my soul doesn\u2019t cry out for expensive drunken nights.

Ride around (very slowly) only for about 10 or 15 minutes. Make a stop while the tour guide talks about the area and gives us some water if we&#8217;re desperate and dying of thirst. The city was small enough that we managed to pretty much see all of the touristy things within those 4.5 hours. Pretty decent.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We had some awesome ice cream during the tour. They scoop the icecream in a rose shape! Also grabbed some bean goulash from a local stall\/restaurant thing. Surprisingly also really good. Only cost about 3AUD I think for each bowl of goulash.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1265\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa0024.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1265\" alt=\"FLOWER ICE CREAM!

What wasn&#8217;t so awesome was the fact that it was a rough 45 degree incline or something uphill. It was a pretty long way too. I tried cycling most of it but gave up about 80% of the way through. Steph saw the futility of it and starting walking roughly from the start. Still what a trooper! I&#8217;m very impressed and pleased that she went on this tour, knowing full well the difficulty and duration that it involves. Who knows, maybe next time we can go on a 10 hour tour? That was actually my original plan for this trip. A SEVEN DAY bike tour going all the way from Austria to Budapest. That would&#8217;ve been pretty amazing but considering our performance this time around we probably would never have made it to our destination if we did that tour. Maybe one day in the far future.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1282\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa00292.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1282\" alt=\"Gaaaaaasp \" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa00292.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gaaaaaasp<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1281\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa00301.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1281\" alt=\"Huff...puff...gaaaasp\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa00301.jpg?w=225\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Huff&#8230;puff&#8230;gaaaasp<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1280\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa00291.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1280\" alt=\"Huff...puff\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa00291.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Huff&#8230;puff<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1253\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130430_1448081.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1253\" alt=\"IMG_20130430_144808\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130430_1448081.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ohgodwhy<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1255\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130430_1505041.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1255 \" alt=\"Nice view, horrible camera.

I think Steph decided to lay down somewhere and rest on my lap. At this point the tour guide had a suspicion we were getting tired (HAH) and sped up through the rest of the tour.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So yes. We were kind of tumbling around rather than walkin since our legs were completely busted by the end of the day. So we slowly tumbled over to a decently looking pub restaurant thing. Due to the horrific experience the night before with Hungarian food I don&#8217;t know what we were thinking with going to another Hungarian restaurant. Luckily everything turned out fine. Great service, great food. Its almost as if you can&#8217;t judge a country by only a few of its citizens!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">There is also the fact that yesterday at Rosenstein it was in a really dodgy area. Like, Ballajura pub dodgy or Koondoola dodgy. So maybe the waitress last night was so sick of fighting off druggies or something every night she has turned into a cynical and bitter lady.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So anyway we decided to order some good food to make up for our calorie munching journey (for you fitness geeks, yes I<br \/>\nknow the calories burnt from cycling was insignificant and almost trivial, thankyou). Steph made a point that she always seems to eat more manly food than I do. I can vouch for this. I remember eating some sort of elegant gourmet plum duck pie once while she chomped away at a giant steak. I&#8217;m not quite sure what to make of that.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1276\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa0036.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1276\" alt=\"Steph's energetic face after the tour.\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa0036.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Steph&#8217;s energetic face after the tour.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1277\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa0037.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1277\" alt=\"My energetic face after the tour.\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130501-wa0037.jpg?w=225\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">My energetic face after the tour.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">What I CAN confirm is that yes, this time around she did indeed have a much more manly meal than me.

Steph decided to stay at the apartment and nurse her thighs that were on metaphorical fire. Lindy hopping was pretty great, I met a few people and expanded my mighty global network of fellow Swing Dancers. Did a (very very difficult) beginners lesson and then moved on to some social dancing. This is the only sample of nightlife I had while in Budapest (which is well known for its partying atmosphere) and I enjoyed it. This was on a much smaller scale than the typical partying that goes on in this city though, but then again my soul doesn&#8217;t cry out for expensive drunken nights. Except the beer I bought here cost around 1.5AUD (just a midi though), so maybe not the &#8216;expensive&#8217; part.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1257\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130430_2249011.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1257\" alt=\"Lindy Hopping!

I know I complained about it a few years back in my Hong Kong post but now I realise I was just being a wuss. The speed limit here is 100km\/h which is normal enough. But they often drive as fast as they can. Seriously. Regular speeds of 130km\/h here folks. Interestingly the speedometer has an inbuilt alarm at 120km\/h. Its an alarm that means \u201cWARNING! You\u2019re about to take off!\u201d I think. I can only assume the taxi drivers are wannabe pilots because they all leave the alarm beeping and zoom around 130km\/h anyway.\n\nWe get the business class flight this time! Woot! Steph and I stayed in the business lounge for awhile, had some snacks, had a nap on horrible uncomfortable beds. Steph had to fly out about 5 hours before me so we said our goodbyes.

We headed off to the airport after a rest in the hotel.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I&#8217;m not sure if I mentioned it before but DAMN the taxi drivers here drive so fast! I know I complained about it a few years back in my Hong Kong post but now I realise I was just being a wuss. The speed limit here is 100km\/h which is normal enough. But they often drive as fast as they can. Seriously. Regular speeds of 130km\/h here folks. Interestingly the speedometer has an inbuilt alarm at 120km\/h. Its an alarm that means &#8220;WARNING! You&#8217;re about to take off!&#8221; I think. I can only assume the taxi drivers are wannabe pilots because they all leave the alarm beeping and zoom around 130km\/h anyway.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We get the business class flight this time! Woot! Steph and I stayed in the business lounge for awhile, had some snacks, had a nap on horrible uncomfortable beds. Steph had to fly out about 5 hours before me so we said our goodbyes. She loved the business class flight! Rightfully so too, it&#8217;s a different league to cattle class. Too bad I won&#8217;t be able to enjoy business class much longer after this job in Ghana&#8230;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1321\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130509_074623.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1321\" alt=\"Ahh yes exploring new lands...\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130509_074623.jpg?w=225\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ahh yes exploring new lands&#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1319\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130509_061727.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1319\" alt=\"Oh look I'm back at Silent Hill!\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130509_061727.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oh look I&#8217;m back at Silent Hill!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1320\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130509_074325.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1320\" alt=\"Or is it Half Life 2?\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130509_074325.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Or is it Half Life 2?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1318\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130509_061724.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1318\" alt=\"Or both?\" src=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img_20130509_061724.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Or both?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1322\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/img-20130508-wa0003.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1322\" alt=\"Damn here I am again.

This is our first time in South Korea (not Best Korea). We\u2019ve been in Busan for three days and I\u2019m writing this as I\u2019m on the bullet train to Seoul.\n\nDay 1 mostly consisted of us sleeping the whole day and recovering from the plane trip. I feel like an old man sometimes.\n\nThis country is remarkably similar to Taiwan and Japan. The people are much louder, and a lot worse at staying on their side of the footpath. Steph regularly smashes into people through no fault of her own.\n\nAlmost everyone has a Galaxy, or Galaxy Note phone. Not filthy American or Japanese phones here!\n\nIn fact, everything seems to be made in Korea. Or at least was designed here. The elevators are made by Hyundai, Cuckoo rice cooker, Daewoo\/Kia cars, and Samsung EVERYTHING!\u00a0 Seriously there was a Samsung fashion store. I think Korea was unique in that regard, where they seem to have a few mega corporations duking it out. True capitalism.\n\nNormal tea is really hard to come by. It always ginseng or Herbal teas. Which apparently doesn\u2019t taste good.  \n[![image](https:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/wpid-wp-1397705980858.jpg \"wp-1397705980858.jpg\")](https:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/wpid-wp-1397705980858.jpg)\n\nQuite an aging population as well I think,\u00a0 a lot of elderly people.\n\nREALLY hot food.\n\nWe got a hair cut today. Found some place with no customers. Cost 10 bucks for each of us. I got lucky and had a decent haircut for once instead of my egg shaped shark haircut which I always get when I go overseas. She spent a lot more time on my hair instead of Stephs too for some reason. Maybe my hair was really nice.\n\nWifi everywhere! Subway trains have wifi too! This bullet train has wifi!

These people need to take some sort of orienteering classes.\n\nNot only that, the locals seem to have no idea how to interpret an address (even when written in korean), nor are they aware of landmarks that are close by. In fact I have no idea why the society here has not crumbled yet.\n\nAnyway we gave up and just grabbed a taxi and got him to use the gps to take us to where we needed to go. We were only 300m away from our destination.\n\nThe taxi driver was really excited to have some English speakers and was google translating on his phone spoken korean to English. Whatever he said, it translated to \u201c\u2026 Of the restless\u201d. He showed us the phone with a very excited look on his face. There was a long awkward moment where we were trying to work out what he was trying to tell us but we gave up.\n\n[![image](https:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/wpid-wp-1397959876528.jpeg \"wp-1397959876528\")](https:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/wpid-wp-1397959876528.jpeg)\n\nThe first part of the tour was a korean BBQ dinner.

A working class establishment apparently. The government tried to close these down but resistance from the public prevented this. You can see political posters on the walls, and hanging toilet paper rolls are used to depict the high class nature of this place.\n\n[![image](https:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/wpid-wp-1397959940595.jpeg \"wp-1397959940595\")](https:\/\/nii87.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/wpid-wp-1397959940595.jpeg)\n\nFinal stop we went through the night market when we saw silk worm\u2026 Snacks? Lots of kimchi and kimchi flavoured food. I\u2019m surprised there wasn\u2019t a kimchi drink.\n\nThe crab kimchi thing and beef tatare were pretty good but I think our stomach has already run out of space long ago.\n\nWith every meal, they were accompanied by alchohol. They\u2019re big on getting drunk here.
